  "body": " Integers   An integer is defined as a whole number that does not a fraction or decimal part. Example of integers are e.t.c    Basic operation of integers   Basic operation of integers is either addition, subtraction, addition, division and multiplication.    Addition of integers  Addition is losely defined as putting together. In addition, adding a positive and positive, gives a positive.  An example is .  While adding a positive to a negative, the result and the sign may varry depending on the presidence of a negative or positive sign.       What you need      Paper made number line with values from to     Sheets of papers containing questions.    A central book for recording marks scored by each student.        The teacher to give question papers containing randomized questions.    Each student to attempt the given questions.    The teacher to call out each student for provide his or her answer.    Teacher to validate the answers given.    The student with the highest number of correct answers emerges the winner!        Jane had bags of rice in January. In February she bought an additional bags. What is the current number of bags she has?           Subtraction of integers  Subtraction is deducting one number from the other. For instance, if Olivia had 10 sweets then she ate 3, she remains with 7.  In subtraction a negative and a negative, gives a negative result. While a positive and a negative gives a negative result.  For example and        What you need      List of expense items    Sheets of paper for working out    A pen        The teacher to introduce subtraction through a real-life budgeting scenario with 10,000 shillings.    In groups, students choose expenses and subtract them from their budget.    Students to continue subtracting each item step-by-step and calculate the remaining balance.    Groups share what they spent on, how much is left, and why.    The teacher to introduce surprise expenses to challenge their subtraction and decision-making.        Crown had pieces of apples. He finds out that . are spoilt. How many apples are edible?           Multiplication of integers  Multiplication is defined as repeated addition of a number to itself for the given number of times.       What you need      Manually prepared Bingo cards    A sheet of paper    A pen        The teacher to create bingo cards with a grid.    Teacher to fill in each square with answers to the questions being tested.    The teacher to call out multiplication problems.    Students to look for product of called out problem in the square grid and mark it off.    The first student to get the answer calls out Bingo! And wins        Brian earns 450 shillings per day working at a hardware shop. If he works for 22 days in a month, how much money does he earn in that month?           Division of integers  Division means sharing among a given quantity. A basic example is how a mother decides to share oranges she buys among her children, so that each one gets the same number of oranges.       What you need       pieces of marble.     pieces of paper.    Pen        Under the teachers guidance, the learners to divide themselves in groups of .    Let each group select a group leader.    Let each group leader from all the groups pick marbles from the teacher, until the marbles are finished.    Let all members of each group confirm the number of marbles the leader has.    The results to be recorded by each group on the different sheets of paper    The groups to compare their results to see whether they are the same.        Wangechi has 12 pencils. She decides to arrange them in groups of 3. How many pencils were in each group?            Combined operation of Integers       Mixed operation of integers  In mixed operation of integers, the four basic operations of addition,subtraction,multiplication and division are carried out in the same question. Below is an example    Victoria had 12 boxes each containing 10 apples. She gave 6 apples to her friends.She decided to pack the remaining apples in 2 boxes, how many apples will be contained in each box?       From the 120 apples, she gave 6 to her friends,   When division is carried out,        Real life application of integers  Integers are a part of our daily lives, indeed more so outside school. Integers help us express and deal with real-life situations from positive and negative numbers.  Integers find use in tracking of scores, conducting census, counting items that can't be counted in halves or decimals and even in computer programming and coding.   "

  "body": " Indices and Logarithms   Indices and logarithms are mathematical concepts that deal with powers and roots of numbers. They are used to simplify calculations involving large numbers and to express relationships between quantities in a more manageable form.  Indices, also known as exponents, represent the number of times a base is multiplied by itself. For example, in the expression , is the base and is the exponent or index. This means that is multiplied by itself times.  Logarithms, on the other hand, are the inverse operation of exponentiation. The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which a base must be raised to produce that number. For example, if , then , where is the base and is the number.    Expressing numbers in index form  Index form means a number written with a base and an exponent (also called index or power).   is the number that is multiplied by itself, and (or index) tells how many times the base is used in the multiplication.  A number in index form is written as , where is the base and is the exponent.     1. Identify the base of the number you want to express in index form.  2. Determine the exponent or index, which is the number of times the base is multiplied by itself to obtain the original number.  3. Write the number in the form , where is the base and is the exponent.  For example, the number can be expressed in index form as , since .  Expressing numbers in index form is useful for simplifying calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers or when performing operations like multiplication and division.          Worksheet   pen or pencil and erasers   Optional: bottle tops for modeling  1. Working in groups, look at each number in the first column of the table below.  2. For each number:     Write it as a product of repeated factors (multiply the same number again and again to get the given number).    Write the number as a power (use the base and exponent to show how many times the number is multiplied) or as a product of powers of two different numbers depending on the number given.     3. Fill in the table with your answers.    Number  Product of repeated factors  Power form \/ Products of the power                                                 4. share your work with your fellow learners.      Express each of the following numbers in index form:                     In , the factor is multiplied by itself times.  This implies that the base is and the exponent is .  Therefore, it can be expressed in index form as .    The number can be expressed as a product of repeated factors:   .  This means that the base is and the exponent is , since is multiplied by itself times to get .  Therefore, it can be expressed in index form as .         Express the number in index form.    First,we break down into its prime factors, by finding which prime numbers multiply together to give us .   Remember: Always start with the smallest prime number (which is ). If the number is not divisible by , move to the next prime number ( , then , and so on) until you can not divide further.  To find the prime factors of , we start with the smallest prime number, which is . We check if is divisible by . Since , it divides exactly, so is our first prime factor.         16     8     4     2     1    Next, we take and divide it by again: . It divides exactly, so is our second prime factor.  Now, we take and divide it by once more: . It divides exactly, so is our third prime factor.  Next, we take and divide it by again: . It divides exactly, so is our fourth prime factor.  Finally, we have , which is already a prime number and cannot be divided further.  So, the prime factors of are: .  Since , is multiplied by itself times, we can express in index form as       Given bases , and , express the following numbers in index form using the bases provided:  a)   b)   c)     a) To express in index form using base , we find the prime factorization:      .  Since is multiplied by itself times, we can express in index form as .  b) To express in index form using base , we find the prime factorization:      .  Since is multiplied by itself times, we can express in index form as .  c) To express in index form using base , we find the prime factorization:      .  Since is multiplied by itself times, we can express in index form as .      Laws of indices   The laws of indices, also known as the laws of exponents, are fundamental rules that govern the manipulation of expressions involving powers or indices. These laws are essential for simplifying calculations and solving equations involving exponential terms. Here are the key laws of indices:  1. : When multiplying two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents: .  2. : When dividing two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents: , where .  3. : When raising an expression with an exponent to another exponent, you multiply the exponents: .  4. : When raising a product to an exponent, you raise each factor to the exponent: .  5. : When raising a quotient to an exponent, you raise both the numerator and denominator to the exponent: , where .  6. : Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is equal to one: , where .  7. : A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent: , where .    Multiplication law of indices    The multiplication law of indices states that when you multiply two numbers with the same base, you add their exponents.

Brackets with indices  Brackets with indices are where we have a term inside a bracket with an index (or power) outside of the bracket.  Example:   In general when there is a term inside a bracket with an index (or power) outside of the bracket multiply the powers.            Working in groups of , consider the following expressions.                                        Recall the bracket law of indices and simplify the expressions above.

Therefore, .  Calculating gives us:   .  So, .  Hence, .      Negative indices  Negative indices are used to represent the reciprocal of a number raised to a positive exponent. When a base is raised to a negative exponent, it indicates that the base should be taken as the reciprocal and then raised to the absolute value of the exponent.  For example, if we have a base and a negative exponent , it can be expressed as: . This means that instead of multiplying by itself times, we take the reciprocal of .  Negative indices are particularly useful in simplifying expressions and solving equations involving powers. They allow us to express division in terms of multiplication, making calculations more straightforward.         In groups of , write the following negative index expressions on different pieces of paper.                      Put the pieces of paper on the table and mix them up.

In turns, pick a piece of paper with a negative index expression and calculate its value then match it with the correct positive index equivalent.    Record the results in the table below:    Negative Index Expression  Positive Index Equivalent                               Discuss your work with your fellow learners.

Fractional indices  Fractional indices, also known as rational indices, are used to represent roots of numbers in index form. A fractional index indicates that the base is raised to a power and then the root is taken.  For example, if we have a base and a fractional index , it can be expressed as: . This means that we first raise to the power of and then take the -th root of the result.      1. In groups of , investigate what happens when a number is raised to a fractional exponent.  2.

They are used to solve equations involving exponents, such as exponential equations.     Indices can be used to model population growth and make predictions about future population trends.     They are used in compound interest calculations and other financial applications involving exponential growth.    Find the value of in:                               To solve for :  First express as a prime factor in index form     Hence,   Next we equate the powers:     Hence,        Here, we divide both sides by the coefficient of which is         Applying laws of indices we have:     Hence,           According to definition of zero indices, any number .  Hence,     Since the bases are the same, we equate the powers:                To solve for , we can write as   So,   Next, we need to express to be of base so that both sides have equal bases.  Since, then      Now,   Equating the indices:             Powers of 10 and common logarithms      are numbers that represent a base of raised to an exponent.  The common logarithm, denoted as , is the logarithm to the base . It is used to express numbers in terms of powers of .

  "body": " Compound proportions and Rates of work      Consider the numbers and . and . The two ratios are equal . Therefore, these numbers are said to be proportional.  Generally, any numbers and are said to be proportional if:     or      is the amount of work done per unit of time, often expressed as work divided by time     Proportions are everywhere in our daily life, and are very useful. For example, when preparing a meal for many people you would need to increase the amount of ingredients. To do this without altering the taste, you would have to maintain the proportions between various ingredients. They are also important for determining relationships. If you were at a shop and told an item has a discount of sh but you do not know its original price, this would not be useful information. However, if you are instead told it is off, it has a larger effect as you now know the proportion of the new price versus the old price.    Proportional Parts   is an equation in which two ratios are set equal to each other. For example, if and are in the same ratio as and , we can write this as:   .  This means that the fraction is equal to the fraction .  Generally, if an amount is to be divided in the ratio , then the parts will be divided as follows:      will get      will get      will get        Masomo school has a total of Math textbooks, storybooks, and science textbooks.

If the basket contains fruits in total, how many of each type of fruit are there?    To find the number of each type of fruit, we first calculate the total parts in the ratio: .  Hence number of proportional parts .         What is the value of in     Since can be written as , then to find the value of , we can set up the proportion:   .  Cross-multiplying gives us: .  Simplifying this, we have: .  Dividing both sides by gives us: .  Therefore, the value of is .      Relating different ratios in real life  In real life, we often encounter situations where we need to relate different ratios or rates of work. For example, if James a Grade student can complete a math problem in a minutes, and Esther also a Grade learner completes the same task in minutes, we can express their work rates as ratios. By understanding these ratios, we can determine how long it will take for them to complete the task together or how their individual contributions compare.  Consider the numbers and . You may notice that each number is equal to the previous number multiplied by . The numbers are therefore said to be in continued proportion.  Generally, if numbers, and are in continued proportion:     Since then      If numbers are in continued proportion, they form a geometric progression since they have a common ratio.    Mr Kamboi, a Grade teacher, organized for a short distance race. The race had stations that is station , , , and .  The distance between the stations is as follows:    Station  Position in (m)    A  0    B  20    C  40    D  80    E  160    1.

Let John's current age be and Mary's current age be .  In years, John's age will be and Mary's age will be .  According to the problem, we have:     Cross-multiplying gives us:     Simplifying this, we have:     Rearranging gives us:     Therefore, John's current age is:   , and Mary's current age is: .

If and are in continued proportion, find the value of .    If and are in continued proportion, then we can express this relationship as:     Cross-multiplying gives us:     Simplifying this, we have:     Hence          Working out compound proportions using the ratio method  Two quantities in compound proportion increases or decreases in the same ratio.  To work out compound proportions using the ratio method, you can follow these steps:  1. Identify the two ratios you want to compare or relate.  2. Set up a proportion by equating the two ratios.  3. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.  4. Solve for the unknown variable, if applicable.  5. Check your solution by substituting back into the original ratios to ensure they are equal.  For example, if you have the ratios and , you can set up the proportion as follows:     Cross-multiplying gives you , which simplifies to . This confirms that the two ratios are equivalent.      1. In groups of , measure the length and width of the following trianngles, A and B, using a ruler.       2. Record the measurements of the lengths and widths of triangle A and triangle B.  3. Calculate the ratio of the lengths and widths of triangle A to triangle B.  Example: length ratio = .  4. Compare the two ratios.

More students are admitted to the class such that the ratio of girls to boys remain th same.  The new number of boys in the class is now . Determine the new number of girls in the class using the ratio method.    The initial ratio of girls to boys is , which simplifies to .  Let the number of girls after admission be .  Therefore, setting up the proportion we have:     Hence,   Now, cross-multiplying to solve for :           So, the new number of girls in the class is .      Kipngetich measured the heights of a mango tree and a person standing under the tree in a photo. Their heights in the photo were cm and cm respectively. He observed that the ratio of their actual heights is the same as that in the photo. Determine the actual height of the mango tree if the actual height of the person is meters.    The ratio of the heights in the photo is , which simplifies to .  Let the actual height of the mango tree be meters.  Given:  The actual height of the person is meters.  So, the actual height ratio is:   Setting up the proportion, we have:     Cross-multiplying gives us:      meters.        Rates of work  The rate of work is a measure of how quickly work is done or how much work is completed in a given amount of time. It is often expressed as the amount of work done per unit of time, such as hours, days, or weeks.  When dealing with rates of work, the key is to find out how much work a person\/thing can do in one hour, one day, or any other time unit.         - Sticks or stones ( in number)  - Markers or chalk to draw a start point (where the participants will start picking the sticks or stones) and a drop zone (where they will place the picked sticks or stones).  - A watch to measure the time taken.  - Book and pen to record the results.     Outside your classroom, form groups, A and B.    Mark a start point and a drop zone for each group such that the distance between the start point and the drop zone is metres.    One volunteer from each group will pick up the sticks or stones from the start point and place them in the drop zone. Each start point will have sticks or stones.    The volunteer will start picking the sticks or stones at the same time as the group members starts the watch.    The volunteers will pick one stick or stone at a time and place it in the drop zone. They will continue this until all the sticks or stones are picked.    The group members will stop the watch when the volunteer has placed all the sticks or stones in the drop zone. Group members of group A and B will record the time taken by volunteer from their group to pick all the sticks or stones.    Repeat the activity with volunteers from each group.The volunteers will take turns picking the sticks or stones.    The volunteer from each group will drop the stick or stone in the drop zone and return to tag the next volunteer in the line till the last stick is picked while the group members record the total time taken by volunteers to complete the task.    Go back to your groups and find the average time taken by person to complete the task and the rate of work.  Find also the average time taken by volunteers to complete the task and the rate of work.    Share your findings with the other group.         A group of workers can complete a task in hours. If they work at the same rate, how long will it take them to complete the same task if they double their effort?     If the group of workers can complete a task in hours, doubling their effort means they will work twice as fast.  Therefore, the time taken to complete the same task when they double their effort will be half of hours.     So, it will take them hours to complete the same task if they double their effort.      A factory produces units of a product in hours. If the factory increases its production rate by , how many units will it produce in hours?    The factory's current production rate is units in hours, which means it produces units per hour.  If the factory increases its production rate by , the new production rate will be:     Now, to find out how many units the factory will produce in hours at the new production rate:     Therefore, the factory will produce units in hours after increasing its production rate by .      Mary, John and Essy did a piece of work in hours, hours and hours respectively. How long can John take to complete the work when he starts after Mary and Essy have worked for hours each?    First, we need to find out the amount of work done by Mary, John, and Essy in one hour.  The work done by each person in one hour is:           Therefore, the amount of work Mary and Essy will do in hour is:        For hours, Mary and Essy will have done:     The remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for hours is:     Hence, to find out how long it will take John to complete the remaining work, we can use his rate of work:        Therefore, John will take approximately hours to complete the remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for hours each.

Think of the gentle incline of a ramp at your school, or the varying steepness of a hill on a familiar route. These everyday features are examples of what we call a .  Instead of focusing on the mathematics immediately, it is important to understand that the gradient describes how steep a path is—in other words, it tells us how quickly something rises or falls over a certain distance.  In practical terms, this concept is useful in planning safe ramps, roads, or even understanding the effort required to climb a hill.      Materials Required:    Measuring tape or ruler  Notebook and pencil  Calculator (optional)         Walk around your school and identify at least two sloped surfaces (for example, a ramp near a doorway or a sloping walkway).  Observe and discuss with your group what “steepness” might mean in a real-life context. Is a gently inclined ramp different from a steep staircase?  Using a measuring tape, estimate the change in height (how much the surface rises) and the horizontal distance (how far it extends).  Record your observations in a table. For example:     Sample Slope Measurements    Location  Estimated Rise (m)  Estimated Run (m)    Ramp to hall      Staircase or sloping path         Discuss as a group how the steepness might affect the use of that surface (for example, ease of access for a wheelchair or the energy required for a person climbing the hill).  Discuss as a group how the steepness might affect the use of that surface (for example, ease of access for a wheelchair or the energy required for a person climbing the hill).      Which surface appears steeper? Why might that be important?       After your group activity, let's see how we can measure the steepness more precisely. For example, consider a ramp that you measured earlier.  Suppose one ramp rises over a horizontal distance of . To express its steepness numerically, we use the concept of the gradient, often calculated as:     Thus, for this ramp:     This numerical value, , indicates that for every 1 metre along the ramp, the height increases by 0.3 m.       The gradient gives a numerical value to the concept of steepness, allowing us to compare different slopes and understand their practical implications for safety, accessibility, and design.       In your own words, explain what the term means in real life.    You are shown two walkways:  Walkway A: Rises by over horizontally  Walkway B: Rises by over horizontally  Without calculating, which walkway do you think is steeper? Why?    A builder is constructing a ramp for a wheelchair user. She wants it to be easy to climb. Should the gradient be high or low? Explain your answer.    Name two places in your community where gradients are used on purpose. What purpose do they serve?    Think of a sloped road you've walked or cycled on. Was it easier or harder to move along the slope? What does that tell you about its gradient?       Determining the Gradient from Two Known Points   In many situations, we are given two points on a straight path and want to determine how steep that path is. These two points may represent physical locations, price changes, distances over time, or any relationship that forms a straight line.  To calculate the gradient between any two points on a straight line, we compare how much the value changes vertically (rise) with how much it changes horizontally (run).  If the two points are given as and , then the gradient is calculated using:     This is called the gradient formula. It gives a numerical value to the steepness between the two points.     What you need:    Graph paper or squared notebook  Ruler  Pencil  Calculator       On a piece of graph paper, plot the following two points: and .  Draw a straight line passing through both points using a ruler.  Count how many units up (rise) and how many units across (run) from point A to point B.  Record your values and use the gradient formula to find the slope between the two points.    Discuss: What does the gradient tell you about this line?    Example: Calculating the Gradient  Find the gradient of the line passing through the points and .        Apply the gradient formula:     Therefore, the gradient of the line is . This means for every 1 unit moved to the right, the line goes up by 1.5 units.     The gradient between two points shows how steep the line is. It is found by dividing the change in values (rise) by the change in values (run).    Use the gradient formula to solve the following:    Find the gradient of the line that passes through the points and .    Two points on a road are given as and . What is the gradient of the slope from A to B?    A shop's profit changed from Ksh in week 1 to Ksh in week 4. Find the average rate of profit increase per week (gradient).

Interpret the results of speed calculations in practical contexts (e.g., travel, races, delivery).    These objectives aim to build both conceptual understanding and practical problem-solving skills in calculating speed, time, and distance. You are now ready to begin!     Speed in km\/hr   Matching Question   Match each journey with the correct speed (in km\/h), calculated from the given distance and time.    Remember: Speed = Distance ÷ Time. Be sure to convert minutes to hours where necessary.     150 km in 2 hours  75 km\/h    75 km in 1.5 hours  50 km\/h    120 km in 30 minutes  240 km\/h    90 km in 3 hours  30 km\/h    120 km in 1 hour  120 km\/h    40 km in 0.5 hours  80 km\/h       Speed refers to the rate at which an object changes its position, typically measured in units of distance per time.

David covered meters in minutes. Find his speed in km\/h.    Convert time in minutes to hours.     Convert distance in metres to kilometers.            Samuel left his house at a.m. and arrived at the library at a.m. If the total distance he walked was kilometers, calculate his average speed in kilometers per hour.    First, we need to find the total time taken in hours.  The time taken is from a.m. to a.m., which is minutes.  Convert minutes to hours:     Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:         TODO      Speed in m\/s   Work in groups     Go outside to the school field. Measure and mark a straight distance of 40 meters using a tape measure or meter wheel.    Choose one student from your group to run the -meter distance while another student uses a stopwatch to time how long it takes in seconds.    Record the distance (in meters) and the time taken (in seconds) in your notebook.    Use the formula to calculate the running speed in meters per second (m\/s).    Repeat the activity with different group members and compare your results. Discuss why the speeds may differ among individuals.        Onyango walked km from Lubao to Kakamega town in minutes.

One group member acts as the \"traveler\" and walks the first 100 meters while another times the walk using a stopwatch. Record the time taken for this segment.    After finishing the first part of the journey, the \"traveler\" takes a timed rest break of 5 minutes to simulate a lunch break. Record this break time.    The traveler then walks the second 50-meter stretch. Record the time taken for this second part of the walk.    Now calculate the total distance walked and the total time taken (including the 5-minute break).    Use the formula to compute the average speed in meters per second.    Discuss in your group: How does the break time affect the average speed? What would the speed be without including the break time?       Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It gives us an overall idea of how fast an object is moving, regardless of any variations in speed during the journey.  Consider a scenario where a car travels km in hour, then km in minutes. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?     A cyclist cycles km in hours and then km in hour. What is the average speed of the cyclist for the entire trip?

Amina from Kenya wants to buy a mobile phone from the United States.     In Kenya, she uses Kenyan Shillings (KSh).    In the United States, people use US Dollars ($).    To buy the phone, Amina needs to exchange her Kenyan Shillings for US Dollars.    This is because each country uses its own currency for buying and selling goods and services.    Why?       Different countries use different currencies to manage their own economies and trade with other countries.      John from Uganda wants to visit Tanzania for a holiday.     In Uganda, he uses Ugandan Shillings (UGX).    In Tanzania, people use Tanzanian Shillings (TZS).    When John arrives in Tanzania, he cannot use Ugandan Shillings to pay for food or transport.    He has to exchange his Ugandan Shillings for Tanzanian Shillings at a bank or forex bureau.    Why?       1. Because each country has its own money system, and people in Tanzania only accept Tanzanian Shillings for payment.  2. This is because each country has its own currency for transactions.

  "body": " Approximations and Errors   Approximation is when we give a value that is close to the exact value, but not exact. We use approximation when:     Measuring objects (like length, weight, or time)    Estimating results    Rounding numbers       Given the exact length of a book is be 28.4 cm what is the approximate length of the book?    The exact length of the book is 28cm by rounding off. When we approximate, we might not get the exact value, but we get a value that is close enough for our needs.          Some values are difficult to measure exactly.    Tools like rulers or weighing scales are not always perfectly precise.    It saves time and is good for rough planning or daily use.        Whenever we approximate or measure something, there's a difference between the actual (true) value and the measured value. This difference is called an error.  There are two main types of error:     Absolute Error: This is the difference between the actual value and the measured value. For example, if the actual length of a pencil is 10 cm and you measure it as 9.5 cm, the absolute error is 0.5 cm.  - Therefore absolute error = ∣Measured Value−True Value∣    Relative Error: This tells us how big the error is compared to the true value.  - Relative Error = Absolute Error ÷ True Value       A bag of sugar is labeled 1 kg, but the actual weight is 1.05 kg.    Absolute Error =   Relative Error        Approximation of quantities in measurements       Tip for Learners: Before starting, measure your palm, foot, or stride length in cm.For example:   palm length: 8 cm    foot length: 25 cm    stride length: 75 cm     In these approximations we will use the palms of our hands, feet or strides  Measure the lemgth of your palm using a well labeled ruler.  What did you get?  What about the length of your feet? Measure also and estimate the length of one stride.    Materials Needed:   A ruler or measuring tape    A variety of classroom objects    A notebook or paper for recording measurements       Use your palm, foot, or stride to estimate the length of each object e.g the black board or hite board or the teacher's table.    Count how many units of palm-widths or foot-lengths or stride lengths it takes to span the object.    Multiply by the average length of your palm\/foot to get your estimated length in cm.    Record your estimated lengths in a table.    Now, measure the actual length of each object using a ruler or measuring tape.    Calculate the absolute and percentage error.     ACtivity table    Object  Body Part Used  Count  Estimated Length (cm)  Measured Length (cm)  Absolute Error  Percentage Error (%)    Desk  Palm  5  5 × 8 = 40  42  2 cm  4.76%    Hallway  Stride  6  6 × 60 = 360  370  10 cm  2.70%    Book  Palm  2  2 × 8 = 16  15  1 cm  6.67%         One palm length of Keith is 8cm long. He measures the length of his desk as 5 palm lengths. What is the approximate length of his desk in cm?    To find the approximate length of Keith's desk, we multiply the number of palm lengths by the length of one palm:        b) Approximating mass    Estimate the mass of various classroom objects, then measure their actual mass using a digital or mechanical scale. Compare your estimates with the actual values and calculate the absolute and percentage error.  Choose at least three of the following objects: chalk, textbook, water bottle, eraser, pencil case, or lunchbotatement  Record your estimates and measurements in the table belotatement   Mass table    No.  Object  Estimated Mass (g)  Measured Mass (g)  Absolute Error (g)  Percentage Error (%)    i)        ii)        iii)         After completing the table, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each object.  Use these formulas to calculate errors:    for Absolute Error  for Percentage Error    Reflect on which items you estimated most accurately. What strategies helped? Why is approximating mass useful in real-life situations like shopping, cooking, or science?         Estimate the area of flat surfaces using square units, then measure and calculate the actual area using appropriate tools (e.g., ruler or measuring tape). Compare the estimate with the actual value and find the percentage error.  Choose three flat surfaces such as a desk top, book cover, exercise book page, floor tile, or windowpane. Estimate the area by visualising or using hand-sized units (like palm-sized squares). Then measure the length and width to calculate the actual area.   Estimating area    Item number  Object  Estimated Area (cm²)  Measured Length (cm)  Measured Width (cm)  Actual Area (cm²)  Absolute Error (cm²)  Percentage Error (%)    a)          b)          c)           Use this formula to calculate the actual area:   After completing the table, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each object.    Use these formulas to calculate errors:    for Absolute Error  for Percentage Error    Reflect on which items you estimated most accurately. What strategies helped? Why is approximating area useful in real-life situations like home design, gardening, or art?               Estimate the volume of irregular objects by using water displacement. This method allows you to find the actual volume by measuring how much water is pushed out of the way when the object is fully submerged.  Fill a measuring jug with water and record the initial water level. Carefully submerge an object into the water. Record the new water level. The difference between the two levels gives the actual volume of the object.  Before submerging each object, estimate its volume in millilitres (mL). After measuring, calculate the absolute error and percentage error of your estimate.

Use this formula to calculate the volume of the object:   To determine errors:                  Working in small groups, estimate the total amount of water (in millilitres or litres) required to fill a variety of classroom containers. Then measure the actual capacity of each item using a measuring jug or graduated container. Finally, calculate the absolute and percentage error for each estimate and determine which group made the most accurate overall predictions.  Suggested items: a chalk box, teacher’s water bottle, flower vase, handwashing bucket, and a plastic cup.  Record your data in the table below and fill in the estimated values based on your group's discussions. After measuring, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each item.

Estimate how long it takes to perform common classroom tasks, such as walking to the board, passing out books, or sharpening a pencil. Then use a stopwatch or phone timer to measure the actual time taken. Compare your estimates with actual timings and calculate the absolute and percentage error.  Work in pairs. One student performs the task while the other times and records the data. Then switch roles.

Why might people misjudge time? How can accurate time estimation be useful in exams, presentations, or careers?               Estimate the temperatures of various classroom items or surfaces in degrees Celsius. Then measure the actual temperature using a thermometer. Record your estimates and measured values, then calculate the absolute and percentage errors to evaluate your accuracy.  Suggested items: a cup of tap water, the palm of a student’s hand, a shaded classroom desk, and a closed bottle of water left in the sun.

What influenced your guesses? How does this activity help you in understanding temperature in real-life settings such as weather, body health, or food safety?       Estimating and measuring quantities accurately is a valuable skill in everyday life. Here are some tips to help you improve your estimation and measurement skills:     Always estimate before measuring to develop a sense of approximation and improve reasoning skills.    Use appropriate instruments such as thermometers, measuring jugs, or rulers to validate your estimates.    Calculate absolute and percentage errors to evaluate how close your estimates were to the actual values.      Approximating Temperature Using Estimation   A student places their hand on a metal surface that was exposed to sunlight. They estimate the temperature of the surface to be 38°C based on how warm it feels. Later, they use a digital thermometer and record the actual temperature as 41°C. Approximate the absolute and percentage error in the student's estimation.    Estimated temperature = 38°C  Measured temperature = 41°C        Therefore, the estimated temperature was off by 3°C, which is approximately a 7.32% error.       In this section, we learned how to approximate quantities in measurements and understand the concept of error. We practiced estimating lengths, masses, areas, volumes, temperature and time durations using everyday objects and methods. We also calculated absolute and percentage errors to evaluate the accuracy of our estimates.    Determine errors using estimations and actual meaasurements of quantites      Choose an object (e.g., a pencil, an apple, a cup).  Estimate its length, weight, or volume without measuring it using easuring tools.  Now, measure the actual length, weight or volume using a ruler, scale, or measuring cup.  Record both the estimated and measured values.  Calculate the absolute error by subtracting the estimated value from the actual value.  Activity Table Template   Activity Table Template:    Item  Quantity Type  Estimated Value  Measured Value  Absolute Error    Pencil  length (cm)  10 cm      Apple  weight (g)  12      Cup of water  volume (ml)  250 ml                      Discuss the results with your classmates.

A point is represented as where \"x\" tells you how far to move left or right, and \"y\" tells you how far to move up or down.  When plotting points on a Cartesian plane:   If your point is move units right (positive x direction) and units up (positive y direction).    If the point is move units left (negative x direction) and units down (negative y direction).        Work in pairs   Randomly select points (e.g., (2,3), (-4,1), (0,-2)) and plot them on a Cartesian plane.  Exchange your plotted points with another group and discuss.     Key Takeaway      The axes divide the Cartesian plane into four regions known as quadrants each defined by the x-axis and y-axis and named in an anticlockwise direction:    First Quadrant (Top Right) – Both x and y coordinates are positive (e.g., (3,2)).     Second Quadrant (Top Left) – x is negative, y is positive (e.g., (-4,5)).     Third Quadrant (Bottom Left) – Both x and y coordinates are negative (e.g., (-2,-3)).     Fourth Quadrant (Bottom Right) – x is positive, y is negative (e.g., (6,-1)).           Each quadrant helps categorize points based on their signs, making it useful for graphing equations and solving coordinate geometry problems.  The location of points using the perpendicular axes, that is, x and y axis that meet at right angle, is known as cartesian-coordinate system. The system helps in locating places on the earth surface.    Plot the points on a Cartesian plane.    The correct location of the points based on the x- and y-coordinates on the Cartesian plane is:         Identify and write down the coordinates of the points on the Cartesian plane below.

Similar figures have the same shape but may differ in size. We will learn how to determine if two figures are similar and what properties they share.          Gather various objects found around the school.    Organize the items by grouping those with similar shapes    Explain the reasons why you think the shapes are alike.    Present your findings and explanations to the other groups in the class.               Study the shapes shown below.       Select the shapes that you consider similar and group them together.    State the properties of the shapes that you consider similar.    Share your findings with other groups in the class.        Key Takeaway      Two figures are considered similar when their corresponding sides have the same ratio.    In the case of flat (plane) shapes, their matching interior angles must also be equal.    When naming similar triangles, list the vertices in a way that shows which angles are equal. For instance, if triangle is similar to triangle , it means angle matches angle , angle matches angle , and angle matches angle .       Determine whether triangle and triangle are similar.             corresponds to , corresponds to , and corresponds to .     Since corresponding sides are proportional, we conclude that triangle is similar to triangle .      Drawing Similar Figures in Different Situations          The figure below shows a right angled triangle         Draw another right angled triangle whose sides are two times the sides of .    Discuss the properties of the two triangles.    Share the results with other groups in the class.           In similar figures, the corresponding sides are in proportion, and the corresponding angles are equal. The ratio of corresponding sides can serve as a scale factor for creating similar figures.               determining-properties-of-enlargement-of-different-figures          The figure below shows a rectangle as observed by a learner without a magnifying lens.       The figure below shows the same rectangle as observed by the same learner after using a magnifying lens       The lens is considered to have transformed the rectangle in (1) to give the rectangle in (2). What do you notice?    Identify other real life situations where you have observed this kind of transformation.    Share your results with other groups in the class.                             In an enlargement, the object and its image remain similar. The linear scale factor of the enlargement determines the proportional transformation.    Lines connecting object points to their corresponding image points intersect at the center of enlargement. This property helps in determining the center of enlargement when both the object and its image are given.    To determine the scale factor, divide the length of the enlarged image by the corresponding length of the original object.       Applying Properties of Enlargement to Draw Similar Objects and Their Images           Determining The Linear Scale Factor of Similar Figures     Work in pairs      Draw triangle with the following side lengths as shown in the figure below (not drawn to scale):   cm, cm, and cm.

  "body": " Data Interpretation   By the end of this section, you will be able to:     Define and distinguish between different types of data (primary, secondary, and tertiary).    Identify appropriate data collection methods, including surveys, experiments, and observations.    Organize and present data using frequency distribution tables for both grouped and ungrouped data.    Compute and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) to summarize datasets.    Visualize data effectively through histograms and frequency polygons.    Apply statistical methods to analyze real-world problems and draw meaningful conclusions.       Determining Appropriate Class Width For Grouping Data   Work in Groups:- Measuring Arm Span     You will need a tape measure.    In pairs, measure each other's arm span (from fingertip to fingertip with arms stretched out horizontally) in centimetres. Record the measurements in your exercise books.    Identify the shortest and the longest arm span in your group.    Calculate the difference between the longest and the shortest arm span.    Share your findings with the class—were the tallest students also the ones with the longest arm spans?       Work in Groups:- Temperature  You are provided with the daily afternoon temperatures (in °C) recorded in your area over the last 22 days:   29, 31, 26, 33, 30, 27, 25, 35, 28, 24, 32, 26, 30, 34, 33, 29, 31, 27, 36, 25, 28, 32      Identify the lowest and highest temperatures in the data    Work out the difference between them.    Choose a suitable class width that allows you to divide the temperatures into 5 equal intervals.    Write down the 5 class intervals.    Create a frequency table showing how many days fall into each interval.    Share your findings with your classmates.       width is the size of each interval when grouping data. It is determined by the range of the data and the number of intervals you want to create.  When the data is widely spread out, it is often useful to group the data into intervals. This makes it easier to analyze and interpret the data. The choice of class width is crucial for effective grouping.  The diferrence between the highest and lowest values in a dataset is called the . The range gives you an idea of how spread out the data is.  The lowest number in the class interval is called the , and the highest number is called the . The class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.  To determine an appropriate class width for grouping data, follow these steps:  In the class , the lower limit is and the upper limit is . While the lower class boundary is and the upper class boundary is . The class width is calculated as follows:   Upper class boundary - Lower class boundary = Class width   The range of numbers from smallest to largest in a distribution helps in determining class size as follows: Round up to the next higher whole number if necessary if the result is not a whole number.   Organizing Smartphone Battery Life   The battery life (in hours) of 30 different smartphone models was recorded as follows:  9, 12, 11, 15, 18, 10, 14, 17, 13, 16, 19, 15, 12, 14, 17, 10, 13, 11, 20, 19, 9, 13, 16, 18, 17, 12, 10, 11, 15, 16     What is the shortest and longest battery life recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the battery life data into 6 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The smallest battery life is hours and the longest is hours.    The range of the data is the difference between the longest and shortest battery life:               rounding to nearest whole number gives us a class width of hours.    Therefore, the class intervals are:    Time in Hours  9 - 11  11 - 13  13 - 15  15 - 17  17 - 19  19 - 21          Organising Heights of Students   The heights of 60 students in a class were measured in centimetres and recorded as follows:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210     What is the shortest and heighest height recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the heights into 5 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The shortest height is cm and the highest is cm.                    The class intervals are:    Height (cm)  150 - 161  162 - 173  174 - 185  186 - 197  198 - 210           Drawing Frequency Distribution Tables For Grouped Data   Work in Groups     The numbers of house units in 40 blocks of flats in a certain area are given below:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190    Make a frequency distribution table for the data above, using class intervals of units.    Marks  Tally  Number of House Units    150-157   7    158-165      166-173      174-181      182-189      190-197        Share your frequency distribution table with other learners in the class.      A frequency distribution table is a way of organizing data into classes or groups, so as to make the data more meaningful and easier to analyze.                                  Identifying Modal Class of Grouped Data   Work in Groups.     Below is frequency distributiion table showing the marks of learners in a class out of 100 points.    Marks  0-10  11-19  20-29  30-39  40-49  50-59  60-69  70-79  80-89  90-100    Frequency  0  0  1  3  1  3  23  15  15  9           Key Takeaway   The highest frequency in a distribution is called modal frequency . The class that has the highest is reffered to as the modal class.    Work in Groups     The frequency distribution table below shows the number of children per household in a village.    Households  1-5  6-10  11-15  16-20  21-25  26-30  31-35    Frequency  3  4  6  2  1  3  5       State the modal class of the data.    What is the modal frequency?       Share your findings with the other learners in the class.       Sunshine records      Daily hours of sunshine at 50 weather stations in a country were recorded and the results are shown in the frequency table below.    Numbers of Hours  1-3  4-6  7-9  10-12  13-15    Frequency  10  8  14  12  6      State the modal class of the data.       The modal class is hours of sunshine, because it has the highest frequency of .     Masses of men.      The table below gives the masses of men.    Mass  55 - 58  59 - 62  63 - 66  67 - 70  71 - 74  75 - 78  79 - 81    Frequency  7  10  14  17  13  9  5      What is the modal class of the data?    State the modal frequency.          The modal class is kg, because it has the highest frequency of .    The modal frequency is .         Calculating Mean of Grouped Data   Work in Groups.     The table below shows the marks scored by in an assessment.    Marks  Mid point  Number of Learners ( )  f( )    10 - 22   5  80    23 - 35   10  290    36 - 48   20     49 - 61   30     62 - 74   10     75 - 87   5     88 - 100   1       Total = 81  Total =       Complete the table.    Use the table to determine the mean mark.       Share your work with other learners in the class.       Key Takeaway.   When data is organized into class intervals, each interval is represented by its mid-point , which is the average of the lower and upper boundaries of that class.  Mid-point can be denoted as;      Mean is represented by the symbol , read as bar.  Thus,   The symbol (sigma) means \"sum of\" and is used to indicate that you should add up all the values in the specified range.    The table below shows given masses of men working in a shop. Calculate the mean mass.    Mass (kg)           Mid point                             Determining the Median of Grouped Data                          "
