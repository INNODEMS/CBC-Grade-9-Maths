  "body": " Integers   An integer is defined as a whole number that does not a fraction or decimal part. Example of integers are e.t.c    Basic operation of integers   Basic operation of integers is either addition, subtraction, addition, division and multiplication.    Addition of integers  Addition is losely defined as putting together. In addition, adding a positive and positive, gives a positive.  An example is .  While adding a positive to a negative, the result and the sign may varry depending on the presidence of a negative or positive sign.

Teacher to validate the answers given.    The student with the highest number of correct answers emerges the winner!        Jane had bags of rice in January. In February she bought an additional bags. What is the current number of bags she has?           Evaluate     Simply add       During a hiking trip, a group of students recorded their changes in elevation throughout the day. In the morning, they ascended meters up a hill.Then, they descended meters into a small valley. After lunch, they climbed up again by meters, but later slipped and went down by meters due to a steep slope. What was the group's final elevation change relative to their starting point? Explain your answer using integer operations.           Subtraction of integers  Subtraction is deducting one number from the other. For instance, if Olivia had 10 sweets then she ate 3, she remains with 7.  In subtraction a negative and a negative, gives a negative result. While a positive and a negative gives a negative result.  For example and        What you need      List of expense items    Sheets of paper for working out    A pen        The teacher to introduce subtraction through a real-life budgeting scenario with 10,000 shillings.    In groups, students choose expenses and subtract them from their budget.    Students to continue subtracting each item step-by-step and calculate the remaining balance.    Groups share what they spent on, how much is left, and why.    The teacher to introduce surprise expenses to challenge their subtraction and decision-making.        Crown had pieces of apples.

Solve for :            Solve for :      HINT : (- -) = +        Multiplication of integers  Multiplication is defined as repeated addition of a number to itself for the given number of times.       What you need      Manually prepared Bingo cards    A sheet of paper    A pen        The teacher to create bingo cards with a grid.    Teacher to fill in each square with answers to the questions being tested.    The teacher to call out multiplication problems.    Students to look for product of called out problem in the square grid and mark it off.    The first student to get the answer calls out Bingo! And wins        Brian earns 450 shillings per day working at a hardware shop. If he works for 22 days in a month, how much money does he earn in that month?           Evaluate:            Solve:            Division of integers  Division means sharing among a given quantity. A basic example is how a mother decides to sha]re oranges she buys among her children, so that each one gets the same number of oranges.       What you need       pieces of marble.     pieces of paper.    Pen        Under the teachers guidance, the learners to divide themselves in groups of .    Let each group select a group leader.    Let each group leader from all the groups pick marbles from the teacher, until the marbles are finished.    Let all members of each group confirm the number of marbles the leader has.    The results to be recorded by each group on the different sheets of paper.    The groups to compare their results to see whether they are the same.        Wangechi has 12 pencils. She decides to arrange them in groups of 3. How many pencils were in each group?           Evaluate :            Solve :                    This channel guides through the steps of working out basic integer operations.            Combined operation of Integers   Combined operation of integers refers to representation and calculation of basic mathematics operations in a single question.    Mixed operation of integers  In mixed operation of integers, the four basic operations of addition,subtraction,multiplication and division are carried out in the same question. Below is an example    Victoria had 12 boxes each containing 10 apples. She gave 6 apples to her friends.She decided to pack the remaining apples in 2 boxes, how many apples will be contained in each box?       From the 120 apples, she gave 6 to her friends,   When division is carried out,       Evaluate the expression :     Observe the rule:          Real life application of integers  Integers are a part of our daily lives, indeed more so outside school. Integers help us express and deal with real-life situations from positive and negative numbers.  Integers find use in tracking of scores, conducting census, counting items that can't be counted in halves or decimals and even in computer programming and coding.   "

  "body": " Compound proportions and Rates of work   Any numbers and are said to be proportional if their ratios are equal, that is:    or   For example, consider the numbers and . Since and , the two ratios are equal . Therefore, these four numbers are proportional.  Proportions appear everywhere in our daily life. For instance, when preparing a meal for many people you would need to increase the amount of ingredients. To keep the same taste, you must maintain the proportions between them. Similarly, proportions help us compare relationships in areas such as speed, scale drawings, and work problems.   is the amount of work done per unit of time, often expressed as work divided by time    Proportional Parts     Work in Groups    Instructions   Masomo School has a total of Mathematics textbooks, storybooks, and Science textbooks.    Find the ratio of Mathematics textbooks to storybooks to Science textbooks.  Express each type of book as a fraction of the total number of books in the school.  Explain the steps you used to obtain these fractions.  The textbooks are to be shared among students in the ratio for Mathematics, storybooks, and Science respectively. Work out how many books of each type each student would get.   Share your work with your fellow learners.          is an equation in which two ratios are set equal to each other. For example, if and are in the same ratio as and , we can write this as:   . This means that the fraction is equal to the fraction .     Key Takeaway   If an amount is to be divided in the ratio , then the proportional parts will be divided as follows:      will get      will get      will get        A basket of fruits contains mangoes, oranges, and bananas in the ratio of . If the basket has a total of fruits, find the number of each type of fruit.    To find the number of each type of fruit, we first add the parts in the ratio: .         Find the value of in the proportion .    Step 1: Recall that if , it can be written as a fraction: .  So, .  Step 2: Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions: .  Step 3: Simplify the equation: .  Step 4: Divide both sides by : .  Therefore, the value of is .      Relating different ratios in real life     Work in Groups    Instructions   Mr Kamboi, a Grade teacher, organized for a short distance race. The race had stations that is station , , , and .  The distance between the stations is as follows:    Station  Position in (m)    A  0    B  20    C  40    D  80    E  160       Use the information in the table to make a sketch showing the stations and the distances between them.    If the distance between the stations is in continued proportion, find the distance between station and , and , and , and and .    Identify any proportional relationships between the distance and and the distance and .    Work out the ratio of and in simplest form.    Share your work with your fellow learners.         If numbers, and are in continued proportion, then:      Since  then    Therefore,        Key Takeaway    When numbers are in continued proportion, they form a geometric progression because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the same common ratio.   For example, consider the numbers . Here, each number is equal to the previous number multiplied by . Since the common ratio is , the four numbers are said to be in continued proportion.   In real life, ratios help us compare quantities. For example, if James takes minutes to solve a math problem and Esther takes minutes for the same task, we can compare their times using the ratio . Ratios like this allow us to see how one quantity relates to another in everyday situations.    If the ratio of the ages of John and Mary is , and the ratio of their ages in years will be , what are their current ages?    Let John's current age be and Mary's current age be .  In years, their ages will be and respectively.  Since the ratio of their ages at that time is given as , we can write:     Cross-multiplying:     Expanding both sides:     Simplifying gives:     Substituting back:  John's current age = years.  Mary's current age = years.  Therefore, John is years old and Mary is years old.      Given that the ratio , find the ratio     Since , we can let:     Substituting into :     Therefore:     Simplify the ratio by cancelling (where ):     Therefore, the ratio simplifies to .      If and are in continued proportion, find the value of .    If and are in continued proportion, then we can express this relationship as:     Cross-multiplying gives us:     Simplifying this, we have:     Hence,          Working out compound proportions using the ratio method     Work in Groups    What you need      Ruler    Paper    Pencil and eraser    Calculator      Instructions   1. Measure the length and width of the following trianngles, A and B, using a ruler.       2. Record the measurements of the lengths and widths of triangle A and triangle B.  3. Calculate the ratio of the lengths and widths of triangle A to triangle B.  Example: length ratio = .  4. Compare the two ratios. What do you notice about the relationship between the two triangles?  5. Share your work with your fellow learners.     Key Takeaway    Two quantities in compound proportion increases or decreases in the same ratio.  For example, if you have the ratios and , you can set up the proportion as follows:     Cross-multiplying gives you , which simplifies to . This confirms that the two ratios are equivalent.   How to work out compound proportions using the ratio method:     Identify the two ratios you want to compare or relate.    Set up a proportion by equating the two ratios.    Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.    Solve for the unknown variable, if applicable.    Check your solution by substituting back into the original ratios to ensure they are equal.       A class has girls and boys. More students are admitted to the class so that the ratio of girls to boys remains the same. If the new number of boys in the class is , determine the new number of girls using the ratio method.    The initial ratio of girls to boys is:   which simplifies to   Let the number of girls after admission be .  Since the ratio must remain the same:     Cross-multiplying gives:     Dividing both sides by 3:     Therefore, the new number of girls in the class is .      Kipngetich measured the heights of a mango tree and a person in a photo. Their heights in the photo were cm and cm respectively. Since the ratio of their actual heights is the same as in the photo, determine the actual height of the mango tree if the person’s actual height is meters.    The photo ratio is .  Let the actual height of the tree be . Then:     Therefore, the actual height of the mango tree is meters.      Rates of work   Key Takeaway        Work in Groups    What you need   - Sticks or stones ( in number)  - Markers or chalk to draw a start point (where the participants will start picking the sticks or stones) and a drop zone (where they will place the picked sticks or stones).  - A watch to measure the time taken.  - Book and pen to record the results.   Instructions      Outside your classroom, form groups, A and B.    Mark a start point and a drop zone for each group such that the distance between the start point and the drop zone is metres.    One volunteer from each group will pick up the sticks or stones from the start point and place them in the drop zone. Each start point will have sticks or stones.    The volunteer will start picking the sticks or stones at the same time as the group members starts the watch.    The volunteers will pick one stick or stone at a time and place it in the drop zone. They will continue this until all the sticks or stones are picked.    The group members will stop the watch when the volunteer has placed all the sticks or stones in the drop zone. Group members of group A and B will record the time taken by volunteer from their group to pick all the sticks or stones.    Repeat the activity with volunteers from each group.The volunteers will take turns picking the sticks or stones.    The volunteer from each group will drop the stick or stone in the drop zone and return to tag the next volunteer in the line till the last stick is picked while the group members record the total time taken by volunteers to complete the task.    Go back to your groups and find the average time taken by person to complete the task and the rate of work.  Find also the average time taken by volunteers to complete the task and the rate of work.    Share your findings with the other learners.         The rate of work is a measure of how quickly work is done or how much work is completed in a given amount of time. It is often expressed as the amount of work done per unit of time, such as hours, days, or weeks.     Key Takeaway    To solve work-rate problems, first determine how much work is completed in a single unit of time (such as one hour or one day).   The rate of work is given by:       A group of workers can complete a task in hours. If they work at the same rate, how long will it take them to complete the same task if they double their effort?    Let the whole task be unit of work.  Original rate:     Doubling effort doubles the rate:    Time = work ÷ rate:    Therefore, it will take hours.      A factory produces units of a product in hours. If the factory increases its production rate by , how many units will it produce in hours?    First, find the current rate.    Next, increase rate by .    Finally, find production in hours.    Therefore, the factory will produce units in hours.      Mary, John and Essy did a piece of work in hours, hours and hours respectively. How long can John take to complete the work when he starts after Mary and Essy have worked for hours each?    The work done by each person in one hour is given as follows:   The combined rate of Mary and Essy is:   In hours, Mary and Essy together will complete:   The remaining portion of work is therefore:   To finish this, John working alone will take:   Hence, John will require hours, to complete the remaining work.

A matrix (plural: matrices) is a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions that are organized in rows and columns, and enclosed by brackets.  Each number in a matrix is called an or . The position of each element is identified by its row number and column number.     Let matrix   This matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns, so we call it a matrix (read: \"2 by 2 matrix\").  The number is in the .  The number is in the .    Identifying a Matrix in Different Situations  A is a way of organizing numbers or information in rows and columns—just like the tables you have seen in other topics, such as measurement and data handling. Matrices help us organize, compare, and analyze data efficiently.  Matrices are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing real-world data, such as sports scores, business sales, or scientific results. By turning tables into matrices, we can use mathematical methods to solve problems more easily.   Work in Groups  The Greenfield School Cafeteria prepares meals for students in three school levels: Lower Primary , Upper Primary , and Secondary . Each week, they prepare two types of meals: Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian . The number of meals prepared (in hundreds) for Week 1 and Week 2 is recorded in the tables below:         Week 1 Meal Data     School Level  Vegetarian  Non-Vegetarian    Lower Primary  4  6    Upper Primary  3  5    Secondary  2  7           Week 2 Meal Data     School Level  Vegetarian  Non-Vegetarian    Lower Primary  5  4    Upper Primary  4  6    Secondary  3  8        Notebook or writing pad  Pen or pencil       Carefully study the tables for Week 1 and Week 2.

We compare the Term 2 column: Alice = 5, Brian = 6, Carol = 4. The highest number is , which belongs to .  How many books did Brian read in total?  We add the numbers in Brian's row: 3 (Term 1) + 6 (Term 2) = 9. therefore he read a total of .        Determining the Order of a Matrix in Different Situations  The order of a matrix tells us how many rows and columns it has. This is written as rows × columns (for example, 2 × 3 means 2 rows and 3 columns). Knowing the order helps us describe, compare, and use tables and schedules correctly in real life.   Work in Pairs  The following table shows the number of students in four different classes (A, B, C, D) over three days:     Day 1  Day 2  Day 3    Class A  30  28  29    Class B  27  29  28    Class C  25  26  27    Class D  32  31  30        Notebook  Pen or pencil        Write the data as a matrix S.     What is the order of matrix S?  What does each row and each column represent?  If you wanted to add another class or another day, how would the order of the matrix change?       Why is it important to know the order of a matrix when organizing data?  Can you think of a real-life example where knowing the order of a matrix is helpful?       How does the order of a matrix help you describe and use tables or schedules?  Share your answers with another pair and discuss any differences.       Key Takeaway  The order of a matrix helps us describe and use tables, schedules, and data sets correctly in real life. It tells us how much information a matrix can hold.    What is the order of the matrix B below?  What does the entry in the second row, third column represent?          Count the number of rows.  There are 3 rows (each row represents a student).      Count the number of columns.  There are 4 columns (each column represents a month).      Write the order as rows × columns.  So, the order is 3 × 4.      Interpret the meaning.  The entry in the second row, third column (5) means Brian borrowed 5 books in Month 3.         Determining the Position of Items in a Matrix in Different Situations  Every number or item in a matrix has a special place, just like a seat in a classroom or a product on a shelf. We use the row and column numbers to find the exact position of each item. This helps us quickly locate information in tables, scoreboards, or lists.   Imagine a 3×3 matrix representing a simple map. Each cell can have a value: 0 (empty), 1 (tree), 2 (house), 3 (treasure). The map is represented by the following matrix:     What you need:    Notebook  Pen or pencil         What is at position (2,2)? What does it represent?  List all the positions where there is a house.  If you start at (1,1) and move to (2,2), what do you find?      Draw a simple sketch of the map using the matrix values as symbols (0=empty, 1=tree, 2=house, 3=treasure).      How does knowing the position (row, column) help you find information quickly?  Can you think of another example (like a seating chart or timetable) where positions in a matrix are useful?      Share your map and answers with another group. Did you find the same locations for the houses and treasure?       Key Takeaway  The position (row, column) helps us locate and understand data in real-life matrices, maps, and matrices. It makes finding information quick and fun!       What is at position (2,2) in the matrix below?    List all positions where there is a house (2).    If you start at (1,1) and move to (2,2), what do you find?             Look up the value at (2,2):    The value is 3 ( ).    Find all positions with value 2 (house):    (2,1)  (3,2)      Moving from (1,1) to (2,2) leads to the treasure.    Students draw a matrix and fill in the symbols for each value.         Determining Compatibility of Matrices in Addition and Subtraction  In real life, we often want to combine or compare data from different sources—like adding up sales from two weeks or comparing scores from two rounds of a game. To do this with matrices, the data must be organized in the same way. This means the matrices must have the same number of rows and columns (the same ).  Let's see how this works with a real-life example.   Work in Groups  The table below shows the number of books borrowed from a library by three students (Alice, Brian, and Carol) in two different months, and then in two more months.     Month 1  Month 2    Alice  4  5    Brian  3  6    Carol  5  4    The next month, the same students borrowed the following number of books:     Month 3  Month 4    Alice  6  3    Brian  2  7    Carol  4  5        Notebook  Pen or pencil        Write the Month 1 & 2 data as a matrix A and the Month 3 & 4 data as a matrix B.     Can you add matrices A and B? Why or why not?  Suppose you had a table for a different group of students with only two rows. Could you add this to matrix A? Why or why not?       What does the sum A + B represent in this context?  Why is it important for matrices to have the same order before adding or subtracting?       How does this rule help us combine or compare real-life data correctly?  Share your answers and reasoning with another group.       Key Takeaway  You can only add or subtract matrices if they have the same order (the same number of rows and columns). This allows us to combine or compare real-life data correctly.    Add the matrices A and B below?  What does the result mean?             Check the order of both matrices.    Matrix : 2 rows, 2 columns. Matrix : 2 rows, 2 columns. The orders are the same.    Add corresponding entries:       Interpret the result.    The resulting matrix shows the total number of items sold by both shops on each day.         Carry Out Addition and Subtraction of Matrices in Real Life Situations  In everyday life, we often need to combine or compare data from different sources—such as adding up scores from two football matches or finding the difference in sales between two weeks. Matrices make these calculations easy and organized!   Interactive Matrix Calculator (Work in Pairs)  Use the GeoGebra applet below to practice adding and subtracting matrices. You can choose either 2×2 or 3×3 matrices, enter your own values, and select the operation (addition or subtraction).  What you need:    Computer or tablet with internet access  GeoGebra applet (link or embedded)        Choose the size of your matrices (2×2 or 3×3) in the GeoGebra applet.  Enter the values for both matrices.  Select either addition (+) or subtraction (−).  Click \"Solve\" to see the result instantly.     Try changing one value. How does it affect the result?  Which is easier: doing the calculation by hand or using the tool? Why?               How does using GeoGebra help you understand matrix operations?  In what real-life situations might you need to add or subtract matrices?       Share your findings with another pair. Did you get the same results?  Which method did you prefer and why?       Key Takeaway  Matrix addition and subtraction help us combine and compare real-life data, making it easier to analyze results and identify patterns.       We have two vendors selling apples and oranges over two days. The sales data is represented in matrices as follows:    Find A + B and A - B for the matrices below.    Explain what the results mean in this context.           Step 1: Add the matrices:     Step 2: Subtract the matrices:     Step 3: Interpret the results.    shows the total number of apples and oranges sold by both vendors each day.  shows the difference in sales between Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 for each fruit and day. A negative number means Vendor 2 sold more of that item than Vendor 1.        Reflecting on the Use of Matrices in Real Life Situations  Matrices are everywhere in our daily lives! Whenever you see a table, a timetable, or a chart, you are looking at data that can be organized as a matrix. Matrices help us organize, compare, and analyze information quickly and clearly.   Investigation – Who Performed Best? (Work in Groups)  The local sports club keeps a matrix of scores for three teams (Lions, Tigers, Eagles) over four games. The club wants to know which team performed best overall and in which game the highest score was recorded.     (Rows: Lions, Tigers, Eagles; Columns: Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, Game 4)  What you need:    Notebook  Pen or pencil         Find the total score for each team.  Find the highest score in each game.  Decide which team performed best overall.  Identify the game with the highest single score and which team achieved it.      How does using a matrix help you answer these questions quickly?  Can you think of another example where a matrix would help you analyze data in real life?      Share your answers with another group. Did you agree on the best team and the highest score?         Matrices are powerful tools for organizing, analyzing, and solving real-life problems. They help us see patterns and make decisions based on data       Find the total score for each team in the matrix below.    Which team performed best overall?    What was the highest single score and which team achieved it?             Add up each row for team totals:    Lions: 12+15+14+10 = 51  Tigers: 10+18+13+12 = 53  Eagles: 14+11+16+15 = 56      Find the highest score in each column (game):    Game 1: 14 (Eagles)  Game 2: 18 (Tigers)  Game 3: 16 (Eagles)  Game 4: 15 (Eagles)      The best overall team is Eagles (56 points).    Step 4: The highest single score is 18 (Tigers, Game 2).    Using a matrix makes it easy to compare, total, and analyze scores at a glance!        "

Think of the gentle incline of a ramp at your school, or the varying steepness of a hill on a familiar route. These everyday features are examples of what we call a .  Instead of focusing on the mathematics immediately, it is important to understand that the gradient describes how steep a path is. It tells us how quickly something rises or falls over a certain distance.  In practical terms, this concept is useful in planning safe ramps, roads, or even understanding the effort required to climb a hill.   Work in groups  What you need:    Measuring tape or ruler  Notebook and pencil  A Calculator     Instructions:     Walk around your school and identify at least two sloped surfaces (for example, a ramp near a doorway or a sloping walkway).  Observe and discuss with your group what “steepness” might mean in a real-life context. Is a gently inclined ramp different from a steep staircase?  Using a measuring tape, estimate the change in height (how much the surface rises) and the horizontal distance (how far it extends).  Record your observations in a table. For example:     Sample Slope Measurements    Location  Estimated Rise (m)  Estimated Run (m)    Ramp to hall      Staircase or sloping path         Discuss as a group how the steepness might affect the use of that surface (for example, ease of access for a wheelchair or the energy required for a person climbing the hill).  Discuss as a group how the steepness might affect the use of that surface (for example, ease of access for a wheelchair or the energy required for a person climbing the hill).      Which surface appears steeper? Why might that be important?      Key Takeaway:   The gradient gives a numerical value to the concept of steepness, allowing us to compare different slopes and understand their practical implications for safety, accessibility, and design.    Suppose one ramp rises m over a horizontal distance of m. Express its steepness as a gradient.    To find the gradient, we use the formula:     Here, the rise is and the run is      This means that for every m you move horizontally, the ramp rises by m.         In your own words, explain what the term means in real life.    You are shown two walkways:  Walkway A: Rises by over horizontally  Walkway B: Rises by over horizontally  Without calculating, which walkway do you think is steeper? Why?    A builder is constructing a ramp for a wheelchair user. She wants it to be easy to climb. Should the gradient be high or low? Explain your answer.    Name two places in your community where gradients are used on purpose. What purpose do they serve?    Think of a sloped road you've walked or cycled on. Was it easier or harder to move along the slope? What does that tell you about its gradient?        Determining the Gradient from Two Known Points  In many situations, we are given two points on a straight path and want to determine how steep that path is. These two points may represent physical locations, price changes, distances over time, or any relationship that forms a straight line.  To calculate the gradient between any two points on a straight line, we compare how much the value changes vertically (rise) with how much it changes horizontally (run).  Gradients are useful in describing real situations such as speed, price change, or slope of land.   Work in groups  What you need:    Graph paper or squared notebook  Ruler  Pencil  Calculator    Instructions:    On a piece of graph paper, plot the following two points: and .  Draw a straight line passing through both points using a ruler.  Count how many units up (rise) and how many units across (run) from point A to point B.  Record your values and use the gradient formula to find the slope between the two points.    Discuss: What does the gradient tell you about this line?   Key Takeaway:  The gradient between two points shows how steep the line is. It is found by dividing the change in values (rise) by the change in values (run).    Find the gradient of the line passing through the points and .          Apply the gradient formula:     Therefore, the gradient of the line is . This means for every unit moved to the right, the line goes up by units.

What is the gradient of the slope from A to B?    A shop's profit changed from Ksh in week 1 to Ksh in week 4. Find the average rate of profit increase per week (gradient).    If the gradient between two points is zero, what does that tell you about the line? Give an example.        Determining the Equation of a Line Given Two Points  Once you have learned how to calculate the gradient between two points, the next step is to use those two points to determine the unique equation of the line that connects them.  In this section, we will introduce the idea that every straight line in the coordinate plane can be defined by its and a point it passes through. This leads us to the of a line, which can later be rearranged into the slope-intercept form:     where is the gradient and is the y-intercept.  Today, we will combine your earlier work with a new process: determining the line's equation directly from two known points.   Work in groups  What you need:    Graph paper or a squared notebook  Ruler  Pencil and eraser  Calculator     Instructions:     Plot two points on graph paper; for example, use the points and .  Using the method from the previous section, calculate the gradient (m) between the two points.  Select one of the points (either one) to substitute into the point-slope form:   Rearrange the resulting equation into the slope-intercept form .  Discuss your findings and how the line's characteristics (its slope and y-intercept) relate to the points you plotted.      Key Takeaway:   By determining the gradient between two points and substituting one of the points into the point-slope equation, we can derive the unique linear equation that passes through both points. This equation can then be rearranged into the form .    Determine the equation of a line that passes through the points and .    To find the equation of the line, we will follow these steps:   Step 1: Calculate the Gradient   Using the gradient formula:    Step 2: Apply the Point-Slope Form   Choosing point , substitute into the point-slope form:    Step 3: Convert to Slope-Intercept Form   Expand and simplify:     Add to both sides:     This is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.      Solve the following questions:    Find the equation of the line that passes through the points and .    A line passes through and . Determine its gradient and write its equation in the form .    If the line through and has a gradient of , what is the y-intercept ( ) of the line?    Explain what the equation tells you about the relationship between and .        Determining the Equation of a Line from a Known Gradient and a Point  In some cases, we may be told the of a line and given only one point that lies on it. Using this information, we can still find the full equation of the line.  To do this, we use the of a linear equation:     where is the known point and is the gradient. We can rearrange this into the familiar slope-intercept form: .     Work in groups    MWhat you need:     Graph paper or notebook  Ruler  Pencil and calculator    Instructions:    Suppose you are told that a line has a gradient of and passes through the point .  Write the point-slope form using this information.  Rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form ( ).  Plot the point on graph paper, then draw the line using your equation to verify your result.    Discuss with your group: would the result be different if we had chosen a different point?     Key Takeaway:   When given a gradient and one point on a line, you can use the point-slope form to find the full equation of the line. This method is efficient and avoids the need for a second point.    Write the equation of a line that has a gradient and passes through the point .    We know the gradient and the point .

  "body": " Linear Inequalities       Interpreting Linear Inequalities in One and Two Unknowns  In daily life, we often work with conditions or limits, but sometimes we work with exact values like \"You must be at least years old to vote\" or \"The bag should not weigh more than kg\".  A is a mathematical sentence that uses inequality symbols instead of the equals sign. These include:  (less than)  (less than or equal to)  (greater than)  (greater than or equal to)    Linear inequalities can have one unknown (e.g., ) or two unknowns (e.g., ), and they represent a range of possible values that satisfy the condition.   Work in groups  What You need:    Notebook  Pencil or pen    Instructions:  Discuss the following real-life situations and write an appropriate linear inequality for each.    A student must score at least marks to pass an exam. Let be the marks scored.  A matatu cannot carry more than passengers. Let be the number of passengers.  A phone costs more than Ksh . Let be the cost.  The total luggage weight must be less than or equal to kg. Let be the weight.    After writing the inequalities:  Identify whether each inequality has one or two unknowns.  Explain your interpretation to another group and listen to theirs.      Key Takeaway:   Linear inequalities describe limitations or conditions in real-life situations. They allow us to work with ranges of possible values rather than just one answer.    A parent gives a student Ksh for lunch for the entire week. If lunch costs shillings per day and they have school going days, write an inequality to represent how much can be spent per day by the student.    The total cost for days is . The student cannot spend more than Ksh , so:     Solving the inequality:     This means the student can spend at most Ksh each day.      Answer the following questions in your exercise book.     Write inequalities to represent the following statements:     You must be at least years old to register to vote. Let represent age.    You want to buy pens at Ksh each. You have Ksh .    A shopkeeper must sell more than items to make a profit. Let be the number of items sold.    A student may work at most hours per week. Let be the number of hours worked.       A trip costs Ksh per student. The total cost should not exceed Ksh . Let be the number of students. Write and interpret the inequality.         Solving Linear Inequalities in One and Two Unknowns  Solving a linear inequality is similar to solving an equation, except the solution is often a range of values. These values can be shown on a number line (for one variable) or on a coordinate plane (for two variables). Remember, when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses direction.   Work in groups  What you need:    Pencil and ruler  Graph paper or notebook    Instructions:  Consider the following inequalities:          Solve each inequality and represent the solution on a number line.    For each inequality, discuss with your group how the solution set is different from that of an equation.  Share your number line diagrams with another group and compare your ranges.      Key Takeaway:   Solving linear inequalities involves similar steps to solving equations, but always remember to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. For two-variable inequalities, graph the boundary and shade the region of solutions.    Solve and represent the solution to the inequality: on a numberline.       The solution is all values of less than or equal to .  On a number line, this is shown as a solid dot at and shading to the left.     Work in groups  What you need:    Graph paper  Pencils, ruler, and eraser    Instructions:    Plot the boundary line for the inequality . Use a dashed line since the inequality does not include equality.  Pick a test point like to determine which side of the line to shade.  Shade the correct region that represents all solutions to the inequality.  Repeat the process for , this time using a solid line.  Discuss the meaning of overlapping shaded regions if both inequalities were given together.       Solve and graph the inequality: .    Step 1: Identify the boundary line . Since the inequality is , we will draw a solid line.  Step 2: Choose a test point like :   , which is true.  Step 3: Shade the region below the line, since it represents all values of less than or equal to .  The graph shows the line and the shaded region representing the solution set.        Solve and represent the solution on a number line:   Solve and draw a number line for:   Plot the solution set for on a graph.  Plot the region that satisfies both and .  Write a real-life situation that can be modeled using the inequality and explain your reasoning.       Representing Linear Inequalities Graphically  In many real-life situations, we deal with inequalities such as limits, budgets, or boundaries. Graphing these inequalities helps us visualize all the possible solutions that satisfy the conditions.  When a linear inequality involves two variables (like and ), its solution is a region in the coordinate plane, not just a line.  The boundary line helps define where the inequality changes from true to false. We use:  Solid lines for inequalities like or  Dashed lines for inequalities like or     Work in groups  What you need:    Graph paper  Pencil and ruler    Instructions:    Draw a number line on your graph paper.  Solve and plot the inequality .  Use a solid circle for and shade to the right.  Now try using a hollow circle at and shade left.  Discuss: What does overlapping of shaded areas mean?       Graph the inequality on a number line.    Draw a number line with values from to . Put a solid circle at and shade everything to the left.     Work in groups  What you need:    Graph paper  Coloured pencils  Ruler    Instructions:    Draw the line . Use a dashed line since the inequality will not include equality.  Test a point, like . Substitute into .  Since is false, shade the opposite side from .  Repeat the same process for .      Key Takeaway:   Inequalities in two variables describe regions of the graph. Always draw the boundary line first, then use a test point to decide which side to shade. Use dashed or solid lines to indicate strict or inclusive inequalities.    Represent on a graph.      Draw the line using a dashed line.  Use a test point like : → false.  Shade the side that does not contain .  This shaded region shows all values that satisfy .          Draw a number line and graph the inequality .  Represent on the Cartesian plane.  Graph the inequality .  Write two real-life examples that can be represented using inequalities.  If and , shade the region on the number line that satisfies both.      "

Convert minutes to hours:     Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:         TODO      Speed in m\/s   Work in groups     Go outside to the school field. Measure and mark a straight distance of 40 meters using a tape measure or meter wheel.    Choose one student from your group to run the -meter distance while another student uses a stopwatch to time how long it takes in seconds.    Record the distance (in meters) and the time taken (in seconds) in your notebook.    Use the formula to calculate the running speed in meters per second (m\/s).    Repeat the activity with different group members and compare your results. Discuss why the speeds may differ among individuals.        Onyango walked km from Lubao to Kakamega town in minutes. Determine his speed in metres per second (m\/s).    Speed   Convert the distance from kilometres to metres:   km = (   ) m = m  Convert the time from minutes to seconds:   minutes = (   ) s = s  Speed   Speed       A car travels m in seconds. What is its speed in metres per second (m\/s)?    Speed   Speed       TODO      Average Speed    Work in groups     Identify a measured path around the school where a \"journey\" can take place, such as walking 100 meters from the gate to a classroom block, and another 50 meters from the classroom block to the school canteen.    One group member acts as the \"traveler\" and walks the first 100 meters while another times the walk using a stopwatch. Record the time taken for this segment.    After finishing the first part of the journey, the \"traveler\" takes a timed rest break of 5 minutes to simulate a lunch break. Record this break time.    The traveler then walks the second 50-meter stretch. Record the time taken for this second part of the walk.    Now calculate the total distance walked and the total time taken (including the 5-minute break).    Use the formula to compute the average speed in meters per second.    Discuss in your group: How does the break time affect the average speed? What would the speed be without including the break time?       Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It gives us an overall idea of how fast an object is moving, regardless of any variations in speed during the journey.  Consider a scenario where a car travels km in hour, then km in minutes. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?     A cyclist cycles km in hours and then km in hour. What is the average speed of the cyclist for the entire trip?    Total distance = km + km = km  Total time = hours + hour = hours  Average speed =       A car travels km in hours, then takes a -minute break, and later travels another km in hours. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?    Total distance = km + km = km  Total time = hours + hour (break) + hours = hours  Average speed =       TODO      Velocity   Work in groups           Velocity of an object          Velocity is refered to as distance covered in a specific direction per unit time. It is a vector quantity , meaning it has both magnitude and direction.      A car travels meters to the east in seconds. What is its velocity in m\/s?    Velocity =    .      A Spacecraft travels kilometers to the north in minutes. Calculate its velocity in km\/h.    First, convert the time from minutes to hours: .  Velocity =    .      TODO      Acceleration   Work in groups.     From the left handside of below, click to check the Road, Photos, Markers and Graphs boxes.    Click the Play button to start the simulation.    Observe the motion of the two objects as they accelerate.    Click the Reset button to reset the simulation and Pause button to pause the simulation.    Discuss and share with the rest of the class your observations about the acceleration of the objects.      Acceleration of an object          Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity per unit time. It is a vector quantity , meaning it has both magnitude and direction.  Acceleration can be positive (speeding up), negative (slowing down), or zero (constant speed).  The formula for acceleration is given by:       A Jet fighter accelerates from m\/s to m\/s in seconds. What is its acceleration?    Initial velocity m\/s  Final velocity m\/s  Time taken seconds  Acceleration          A Bus slows down from m\/s to m\/s in seconds. Calculate its acceleration?    Initial velocity m\/s  Final velocity m\/s  Time taken seconds  Acceleration          A car accelerates from m\/s to m\/s in seconds. Calculate its acceleration.      TODO      Identifying Longitudes   Work in groups            Work in pairs or small groups.  In this activity, you will use an orange to explore the concept of longitudes, including the Prime Meridian and other meridians on a globe.   Materials Needed:     1 orange (per group)  Marker pen (preferably black or dark color)  Ruler (optional)  Toothpicks or a small container (optional, to hold the orange steady)     Instructions:     Take the orange and place it on a flat surface. If it keeps rolling, use a small container or toothpicks to hold it steady.    Use a marker to carefully draw a dotted line from the top of the orange (where the stem scar is) to the bottom. This line should pass through the center and divide the orange vertically into two equal parts.    Discuss with your group:  What do we call this vertical line on the real Earth?  What are the names of the two parts it divides the globe into?      On either side of the dotted line, draw 2 or 3 more curved lines from top to bottom of the orange (north to south), equally spaced. These lines should bend slightly as if wrapping around the globe.    These curved lines represent other meridians. What name do we give to all such vertical lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole?    Label the dotted vertical line as the Prime Meridian and one of the other lines as 60° East or 30° West (your choice).    Now, use your finger to point to a location between two of the meridian lines. Pretend it is a city on Earth.  Can you estimate its longitude based on your lines?  What would you call its location: East or West of the Prime Meridian?      Share your orange globe and observations with the rest of the class. Explain what the lines mean and how they help us locate places on Earth.           Longitude are imaginary lines that run from the North Pole to the South Pole , measuring the distance east or west of the prime meridian.    Any north-sourth line can be meridian . A prime meridian is the meridian chosen to be zero degrees longitude for common reference.  Prime meridian is also known as the Greenwich Meridian because it passes through the Greenwich Observatory in London, England.   Identifying Longitudes        Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. In we can see the prime meridian at and other longitudes marked. The longitude is 28 degrees east of the prime meridian, while is 65 degrees west of the prime meridian.    In the diagram below, identify points that are on the same longitude.        Points E, F and G are on the same longitude.  Points B and C are on the same longitude.      Identify the longitudes of the points A, B, C, D, E and F in the diagram below.           B is of the prime meridian.    C is of the prime meridian.    D is of the prime meridian.    E is of the prime meridian.    F is of the prime meridian.         TODO      Relating Longitudes to Time   Work in groups.  Use the diagram in and follow the steps below:    Identify pairs of cities that lie on the same longitude. Record their names and longitudes.    Use the rule that places on the same longitude experience the same local time to explain which cities share the same time of day.    Identify pairs of cities that are equidistant from the Prime Meridian but on opposite sides (e.g., 53°E and 53°W). Discuss whether they experience the same time of day and explain your reasoning.    Discuss: If it is 10:00 AM at City B, what is the time at City E? Use the 4 minutes per degree rule to support your answer.    Present your findings to the class and explain how Earth's rotation affects the relationship between longitude and time.      Work in groups               The earth rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation every 24 hours. This rotation causes the cycle of day and night.  The earth rotates from west to east , which means that as the earth rotates, different parts of the world experience daylight and darkness at different times.  Places that are located at the same longitude will experience the same time of day, while places that are located at different longitudes will experience different times of day.     In below, cities A, B, C, D, E, and F are located at various longitudes. Determine which of these cities experience the same time of day.     A diagram showing the relationship between longitudes and time zones.       Cities B and C lie on the same longitude ( E), which means they experience the same local time.  Cities E and F are at W, and City D is at E. Since they are equally distant from the Prime Meridian, they experience the same local time.      TODO      Local time of places on the Earth along different Longitudes   Work in groups.  Use an atlas or a map of the world showing longitudes and the Prime Meridian. Then complete the following tasks:     Identify three towns or cities located at different longitudes (one in the Eastern Hemisphere, one near the Prime Meridian, and one in the Western Hemisphere). Record their longitudes.    Assume the local time in the town closest to the Prime Meridian is noon. Using the concept that of longitude equals minutes, calculate the local time in the other two towns.    Share your group’s findings with the class. Explain how the direction (east or west) of a town’s longitude affected its local time compared to the Prime Meridian.    Discuss: What challenges might arise in global communication or travel due to differences in local time?          The earth rotates on its axis from west to east , which means that places to the east of a given location will experience sunrise earlier than those to the west. This results in different local times for places along different longitudes.  The earth takes hours to complete one full rotation covering degrees of longitude, which means that each hour corresponds to degrees of longitude (360 degrees  hours  degrees\/hour). Therefore, for every degrees of longitude difference between two places, there is a one-hour difference in local time.  Therefore, the earth covers of longitude in minutes. We gain time as we move eastward and lose time as we move westward.     Town A is situated at E longitude. What will be the local time in Town A when it is noon at the Prime Meridian?    Town A is located east of the Prime Meridian. To find the time difference, we use the fact that the Earth rotates through of longitude every minutes.  Therefore, the time difference between Town A and the Prime Meridian is:   minutes  Converting minutes into hours and minutes:     Since Town A is east of the Prime Meridian, its local time is ahead.  So, when it is noon at the Prime Meridian, the local time in Town A is PM.      If it is 10:00 am at E, what time is it at W?    The total difference in longitude between E and W is:   degrees  Since the Earth rotates every minutes, the time difference is:   minutes  Converting minutes into hours and minutes:     Since E is east of W, we need to subtract the time difference from the time at E.  Therefore, the time at W is:         If it is 3:00 pm at W, what time is it at E?    The total difference in longitude between W and E is:   degrees  Since the Earth rotates every minutes, the time difference is:   minutes  Converting minutes into hours and minutes:     Since W is west of E, we need to add the time difference to the time at W.  Therefore, the time at E is:         TODO     Explore more on Time, Distance, and Speed     Explore the concept of average speed and how it relates to time and distance with this interactive video.     Explore more on the concept of Acceleration, which is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.        "

Amina from Kenya wants to buy a mobile phone from the United States.     In Kenya, she uses Kenyan Shillings (KSh).    In the United States, people use US Dollars ($).    To buy the phone, Amina needs to exchange her Kenyan Shillings for US Dollars.    This is because each country uses its own currency for buying and selling goods and services.    Why?       Different countries use different currencies to manage their own economies and trade with other countries.      John from Uganda wants to visit Tanzania for a holiday.     In Uganda, he uses Ugandan Shillings (UGX).    In Tanzania, people use Tanzanian Shillings (TZS).    When John arrives in Tanzania, he cannot use Ugandan Shillings to pay for food or transport.    He has to exchange his Ugandan Shillings for Tanzanian Shillings at a bank or forex bureau.    Why?       1. Because each country has its own money system, and people in Tanzania only accept Tanzanian Shillings for payment.  2. This is because each country has its own currency for transactions.      Conversion of currencies to Kenya shillings     Converting Shillings to Notes   In Kenya, money is expressed in shillings (KES) and cents. 1 shilling is equal to 100 cents. We use both coins (for small amounts) and notes (for larger amounts).  In this activity, you will practice converting amounts of money into notes and coins, and convert between shillings and cents.  The available notes in Kenya are Ksh. 1,000, Ksh. 500, Ksh. 200, Ksh. 100 and Ksh. 50  The available coins are Ksh. 20, Ksh. 10.Ksh. 5, Ksh. 2 and Ksh. 1.  Convert the following amounts into notes, coins or cents..  1.Convert Ksh. 350 into notes.  To convert Ksh. 350 into notes, we can use the largest denominations first. The available notes are KES 100, KES 50 in this case. We can express KES 350 as:   So, Ksh. 350 can be made using:   Therefore, KES 350 can be made using 3 notes of KES 100 and 1 note of KES 50.  2. Convert 7 shillings and 85 cents to cents only.  To convert shillings to cents, we multiply the number of shillings by 100 and add the cents.   So, 7 shillings and 85 cents = 785 cents.  Convert 645 cents to shillings and cents.  To convert cents to shillings, we divide the number of cents by 100. The quotient gives us the number of shillings and the remainder gives us the cents   So, 645 cents = 6 shillings and 45 cents.  4. Using 100, 50, and 20 shilling notes, how can you make KES 270?  To make KES 270 using the available notes, we can use:   So, KES 270 can be made using:   Therefore, KES 270 can be made using 2 notes of KES 100, 1 note of KES 50, and 1 note of KES 20.      Exercise: Currency Conversion  Now, try these exercises to practice converting between shillings and cents, and using notes.  1.Convert Ksh. 780 into the fewest number of notes.  2. Convert 925 cents to shillings and cents.  3. Write 12 shillings and 30 cents as cents only.  4. Using 100, 50, and 20 shilling notes, how can you 4make KES 270?

Currency exchange rates            Currency conversion is the process of changing money from one country’s currency into another’s using an exchange rate.    Currency conversion is important for international trade, travel, online shopping, and remittances. It allows individuals and businesses to exchange money for goods and services in different countries, receive and send money from abroad etc.    An exchange rate shows how much one unit of a currency is worth in another currency. Exchange rates change regularly due to supply and demand in the global market.      Exchange rates can vary between banks and money exchange services, so it’s important to check the current rates before converting money.  Sometimes there are charges or fees for converting currency  To convert currency:     Convert $100 to Kenya Shillings, if 1 USD = 150 KES    To convert $100 to KES, we multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate:        Conversion of currencies from Kenya Shillings to other currencies      When you want to convert Kenya Shillings (KES) to other currencies, you need to know the exchange rate. The exchange rate tells you how much one currency is worth in terms of another currency.  Exchange rate link   Click here to check the exchange rate for any country to Ksh.

The government may charge an —a type of tax—to help protect local businesses and raise revenue.  In this activity, you will work in groups to decide which imported product you would choose and calculate the import duty and total cost.  Imagine you are a business owner in Kenya who wants to import products from other countries. The government charges import duty on certain goods, which affects how much you pay for them.  Work in pairs or groups. Each group will pick one product from the list below and follow the steps provided.  Here are some products you can choose from:     School Buses – Value: Ksh 2,000,000 – Import duty: 25%    Laptops – Value: Ksh 120,000 – Import duty: 10%    Clothing – Value: Ksh 80,000 – Import duty: 15%    Machinery – Value: Ksh 300,000 – Import duty: 20%     🔹 Choose one product your group would import and explain why you chose it.  🔹 Calculate the import duty using the formula:   🔹 Add the import duty to the original product value to find the total cost after importing.  🔹 If the import duty was reduced by 5%, how would this affect your total cost? Would it change your choice? Discuss.     Example: Calculating Import Duty on Machinery   A business is importing machinery worth Ksh 300,000. The import duty is 20%.    Step 1: Calculate the import duty: Import Duty = (20 ÷ 100) × 300,000 = Ksh 60,000  Step 2: Add the duty to the original price: Total Cost = 300,000 + 60,000 = Ksh 360,000  So, the total cost after importing is .     Example: Import and Excise Duty Calculation   Alex imported a generator with a customs value of Ksh 60,000. He was charged an import duty of 12% and an excise duty of 15%.    How much did he pay as import duty?  Calculate the excise value for the generator.  Determine the excise duty paid.  How much money did Alex pay in total for the generator?      Calculate the import duty:     Excise value = Customs value + Import duty:     Calculate the excise duty:     Total amount paid = Customs value + Import duty + Excise duty:            Export duty charged on goods and services    In this activity, you will act as an export officer in Kenya. Your task is to understand how export duty works and how it affects the money you earn from exporting goods.  Imagine you run a business in Kenya. You want to export your products to earn money. But the government charges export duty on certain goods. Your job is to choose the best product to export and calculate the duty you will pay.  Work in pairs or groups. Each group picks one product from the list below and follows the steps provided.  Here are some products you can choose from:   Coffee – Value: Ksh 70,000 – Export duty: 5%    Flowers – Value: Ksh 50,000 – Export duty: 4%    Tea – Value: Ksh 90,000 – Export duty: 6%    Hides and Skins – Value: Ksh 60,000 – Export duty: 10%     🔹 Choose one product to export from the list above. Discuss and write down why you chose it.  🔹 Calculate the export duty for your chosen product using this formula:   🔹 Subtract the export duty from the product's value to find out how much money you will actually earn.  🔹 Now imagine the export duty increases by 2%. Recalculate your earnings. Would your group still export the same product? Why or why not?  This activity helps you understand how export duty affects business profits and the choices exporters make in the real world.       Export duty is a tax imposed by the government on goods that are sent out of the country. This duty is charged to ensure that the country benefits from the export of its resources.     When goods are sent out of a country to be sold in other countries, this is called exporting . Sometimes, the government adds a charge called on the goods. This money helps support the country's economy.    A company in Kenya exports coffee worth Ksh 50,000. If the government charges an export duty of 5%, how much duty must the company pay?    To find the export duty, multiply the value of the goods by the duty rate (as a decimal).    Export duty = 5% of Ksh 50,000 = (5\/100) × 50,000 = Ksh 2,500.  The company will pay Ksh 2,500 as export duty.      A farmer exports tea worth Ksh 120,000. If the export duty rate is 3%, how much duty will the farmer pay?    Export duty = 3% of Ksh 120,000 = (3\/100) × 120,000 = Ksh 3,600.   The farmer will pay Ksh 3,600 as export duty.     Example: Export Duty on Mangoes   A trader exports mangoes worth Ksh 80,000. If the export duty rate is 2.5%, how much duty will the trader pay?    To find the export duty, multiply the value of the mangoes by the export duty rate (as a decimal).    Export duty = 2.5% of Ksh 80,000 = (2.5\/100) × 80,000 = Ksh 2,000.  The trader will pay Ksh 2,000 as export duty.      Excise duty charged on goods and services     Understanding Excise Duty   Excise duty is a tax charged by the government on specific goods produced or sold in a country, especially items like fuel, alcohol, cigarettes, and sugary drinks. It is used to reduce consumption of harmful products and to raise government revenue.  In this activity, you'll choose a product, calculate the excise duty, and explore how this tax affects pricing.    Petrol – Price: Ksh 180 per litre – Excise duty: Ksh 21 per litre  Soft drinks – Price: Ksh 150 per litre – Excise duty: 10%  Cigarettes – Price: Ksh 500 per pack – Excise duty: 30%  Beer – Price: Ksh 200 per bottle – Excise duty: Ksh 60 per bottle    🔹 Choose one product from the list above and explain why excise duty is applied to it.  🔹 Calculate the excise duty using the appropriate method: or .  🔹 Add the excise duty to the original price to get the total price a customer would pay.  🔹 Discuss how excise duty might influence consumer behavior. Would people buy less of the product? Why or why not?     Example: Excise Duty on Cigarettes   A packet of cigarettes costs Ksh 500. The excise duty is 30%.    Step 1: Calculate the excise duty: (30 ÷ 100) × 500 = Ksh 150  Step 2: Add the excise duty to the original price: Total Price = 500 + 150 = Ksh 650  The customer will pay for one packet of cigarettes after excise duty is added.     Example: Excise Duty on Soft Drinks in Kenya   In Kenya, a 1-litre bottle of soda costs Ksh 150. The government applies an excise duty of 10%.    Step 1: Calculate the excise duty: (10 ÷ 100) × 150 = Ksh 15  Step 2: Add the duty to the original price: Total Price = 150 + 15 = Ksh 165  In Kenya, the customer pays after excise duty on a 1-litre bottle of soda.     Example: Excise Duty on Petrol in Uganda   In Uganda, the price of petrol is UGX 5,000 per litre. The excise duty is fixed at UGX 1,200 per litre.    Step 1: Add the fixed excise duty to the base price: Total Price = 5,000 + 1,200 = UGX 6,200  In Uganda, the customer pays per litre of petrol including excise duty.      Value added tax charged on goods and services     Activity: Understanding Value Added Tax (VAT)   Amina visited a supermarket to buy some household items. After shopping, she was issued a receipt that included the following items:            Cooking oil  2  300  16%    Books  3  250  0%    Petrol  1  1500  16%    Medicine  1  200  0%    Cooking gas  1  1200  8%    Bread  2  60  0%    Exercise books  5  80  16%    Mobile data bundle  1  300  16%       Calculate the total cost of each item (before VAT).  Calculate the VAT charged for each item where applicable.  Determine the total VAT paid on all items.  What is the grand total Amina paid at the supermarket?  Why do you think some items are charged VAT while others are not?  Discuss the importance of VAT in Kenya with your classmates.        Use of money in day to day activities   Use of Money in Day-to-Day Life   Money plays an important role in our daily lives. We use it to pay for food, transport, education, communication, entertainment, and other basic needs. Making good choices on how to spend and save money is a key life skill.  In this activity, you will explore how money is used in real-life situations and practice basic decision-making with money.    Buying food and groceries for the family  Paying school fees or buying school supplies  Using public transport (e.g., matatus or buses)  Airtime and internet bundles  Savings and mobile money transfers (e.g., M-Pesa)    🔹 Choose two areas from the list above. For each, explain how money is used and how much a typical cost might be.  🔹 Imagine you are given Ksh 1,000. Create a simple spending plan using it to cover needs from the areas you chose.  🔹 What would you do if your money is not enough? What could you reduce, avoid, or save for later?  🔹 Why is it important to budget your money? Share your ideas with a classmate or in a group.     Example: Using Money to Buy School Supplies   A student is given Ksh 1,000 to buy the following school items:    2 Exercise books at Ksh 60 each  1 Mathematical set at Ksh 250  3 Pens at Ksh 25 each    How much will the student spend in total, and how much money will be left after shopping?    Calculate the total cost of exercise books.     Cost of mathematical set is:     Calculate the cost of pens.     Add all the costs to find the total spent.     Subtract total cost from the amount given.           Example: Using Money to Buy Grocery Items   A parent gives Joy Ksh 800 to buy the following from the market:    2 kg of rice at Ksh 150 per kg  1 litre of cooking oil at Ksh 320  6 bananas at Ksh 10 each    Joy needs to calculate the total cost of these items.  How much will Joy spend in total, and how much will remain?    Cost of rice:     Cost of cooking oil:     Cost of bananas:     Total cost:     Remaining money:           Example: Using Money for a School Trip   A group of students is going on a school trip. The bus fare is Ksh 450 per student. Each student also needs Ksh 150 for lunch and Ksh 100 for park entry.  What is the total amount each student should carry for the trip?    Add up the costs:           "

  "body": " Converting Shillings to Notes   In Kenya, money is expressed in shillings (KES) and cents. 1 shilling is equal to 100 cents. We use both coins (for small amounts) and notes (for larger amounts).  In this activity, you will practice converting amounts of money into notes and coins, and convert between shillings and cents.  The available notes in Kenya are Ksh. 1,000, Ksh. 500, Ksh. 200, Ksh. 100 and Ksh. 50  The available coins are Ksh. 20, Ksh. 10.Ksh. 5, Ksh. 2 and Ksh. 1.  Convert the following amounts into notes, coins or cents..  1.Convert Ksh. 350 into notes.  To convert Ksh. 350 into notes, we can use the largest denominations first. The available notes are KES 100, KES 50 in this case. We can express KES 350 as:   So, Ksh. 350 can be made using:   Therefore, KES 350 can be made using 3 notes of KES 100 and 1 note of KES 50.  2. Convert 7 shillings and 85 cents to cents only.  To convert shillings to cents, we multiply the number of shillings by 100 and add the cents.   So, 7 shillings and 85 cents = 785 cents.  Convert 645 cents to shillings and cents.  To convert cents to shillings, we divide the number of cents by 100. The quotient gives us the number of shillings and the remainder gives us the cents   So, 645 cents = 6 shillings and 45 cents.  4. Using 100, 50, and 20 shilling notes, how can you make KES 270?  To make KES 270 using the available notes, we can use:   So, KES 270 can be made using:   Therefore, KES 270 can be made using 2 notes of KES 100, 1 note of KES 50, and 1 note of KES 20.   "

  "body": " Approximations and Errors   Approximation is when we give a value that is close to the exact value, but not exact. We use approximation when:     Measuring objects (like length, weight, or time)    Estimating results    Rounding numbers       Given the exact length of a book is be 28.4 cm what is the approximate length of the book?    The exact length of the book is 28cm by rounding off. When we approximate, we might not get the exact value, but we get a value that is close enough for our needs.          Some values are difficult to measure exactly.    Tools like rulers or weighing scales are not always perfectly precise.    It saves time and is good for rough planning or daily use.        Whenever we approximate or measure something, there's a difference between the actual (true) value and the measured value. This difference is called an error.  There are two main types of error:     Absolute Error: This is the difference between the actual value and the measured value. For example, if the actual length of a pencil is 10 cm and you measure it as 9.5 cm, the absolute error is 0.5 cm.  - Therefore absolute error = ∣Measured Value−True Value∣    Relative Error: This tells us how big the error is compared to the true value.  - Relative Error = Absolute Error ÷ True Value       A bag of sugar is labeled 1 kg, but the actual weight is 1.05 kg.    Absolute Error =   Relative Error        Approximation of quantities in measurements       Tip for Learners: Before starting, measure your palm, foot, or stride length in cm.For example:   palm length: 8 cm    foot length: 25 cm    stride length: 75 cm     In these approximations we will use the palms of our hands, feet or strides  Measure the lemgth of your palm using a well labeled ruler.  What did you get?  What about the length of your feet? Measure also and estimate the length of one stride.    Materials Needed:   A ruler or measuring tape    A variety of classroom objects    A notebook or paper for recording measurements       Use your palm, foot, or stride to estimate the length of each object e.g the black board or hite board or the teacher's table.    Count how many units of palm-widths or foot-lengths or stride lengths it takes to span the object.    Multiply by the average length of your palm\/foot to get your estimated length in cm.    Record your estimated lengths in a table.    Now, measure the actual length of each object using a ruler or measuring tape.    Calculate the absolute and percentage error.

He measures the length of his desk as 5 palm lengths. What is the approximate length of his desk in cm?    To find the approximate length of Keith's desk, we multiply the number of palm lengths by the length of one palm:        b) Approximating mass    Estimate the mass of various classroom objects, then measure their actual mass using a digital or mechanical scale. Compare your estimates with the actual values and calculate the absolute and percentage error.  Choose at least three of the following objects: chalk, textbook, water bottle, eraser, pencil case, or lunchbotatement  Record your estimates and measurements in the table belotatement   Mass table    No.  Object   Estimated  Mass (g)    Measured  mass (g)    Absolute  error (g)    Percentage  error (\\%)     i)         ii)         iii)          After completing the table, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each object.  Use these formulas to calculate errors:    for Absolute Error  for Percentage Error    Reflect on which items you estimated most accurately. What strategies helped? Why is approximating mass useful in real-life situations like shopping, cooking, or science?         Estimate the area of flat surfaces using square units, then measure and calculate the actual area using appropriate tools (e.g., ruler or measuring tape). Compare the estimate with the actual value and find the percentage error.  Choose three flat surfaces such as a desk top, book cover, exercise book page, floor tile, or windowpane. Estimate the area by visualising or using hand-sized units (like palm-sized squares). Then measure the length and width to calculate the actual area.   Estimating area     Item  number   Object   Estimated  area (cm²)    Measured  length (cm)    Measured  width (cm)   Actual  area (cm²)    Absolute  error (cm²)    Percentage  error (\\%)     a)           b)           c)            Use this formula to calculate the actual area:   After completing the table, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each object.    Use these formulas to calculate errors:    for Absolute Error  for Percentage Error    Reflect on which items you estimated most accurately. What strategies helped? Why is approximating area useful in real-life situations like home design, gardening, or art?               Estimate the volume of irregular objects by using water displacement. This method allows you to find the actual volume by measuring how much water is pushed out of the way when the object is fully submerged.  Fill a measuring jug with water and record the initial water level. Carefully submerge an object into the water. Record the new water level. The difference between the two levels gives the actual volume of the object.  Before submerging each object, estimate its volume in millilitres (mL). After measuring, calculate the absolute error and percentage error of your estimate.   Estimating Volume Using Displacement    No.  Object  Estimated Volume (mL)  Initial Water Level (mL)  Final Water Level (mL)  Actual Volume (mL)  Absolute Error (mL)  Percentage Error (%)    1.          2.          3.           Use this formula to calculate the volume of the object:   To determine errors:                  Working in small groups, estimate the total amount of water (in millilitres or litres) required to fill a variety of classroom containers. Then measure the actual capacity of each item using a measuring jug or graduated container. Finally, calculate the absolute and percentage error for each estimate and determine which group made the most accurate overall predictions.  Suggested items: a chalk box, teacher’s water bottle, flower vase, handwashing bucket, and a plastic cup.  Record your data in the table below and fill in the estimated values based on your group's discussions. After measuring, calculate the absolute and percentage errors for each item.

Estimate how long it takes to perform common classroom tasks, such as walking to the board, passing out books, or sharpening a pencil. Then use a stopwatch or phone timer to measure the actual time taken. Compare your estimates with actual timings and calculate the absolute and percentage error.  Work in pairs. One student performs the task while the other times and records the data. Then switch roles.

Why might people misjudge time? How can accurate time estimation be useful in exams, presentations, or careers?               Estimate the temperatures of various classroom items or surfaces in degrees Celsius. Then measure the actual temperature using a thermometer. Record your estimates and measured values, then calculate the absolute and percentage errors to evaluate your accuracy.  Suggested items: a cup of tap water, the palm of a student’s hand, a shaded classroom desk, and a closed bottle of water left in the sun.   Estimating and Measuring Temperature in the Classroom    Item  Estimated Temperature (°C)  Measured Temperature (°C)  Absolute Error (°C)  Percentage Error (%)    Tap water        Palm of hand        Shaded desk        Sun-warmed bottle         Use the following formulas to calculate estimation errors:                Discuss with your group: Which item was most difficult to estimate? What influenced your guesses? How does this activity help you in understanding temperature in real-life settings such as weather, body health, or food safety?       Estimating and measuring quantities accurately is a valuable skill in everyday life. Here are some tips to help you improve your estimation and measurement skills:     Always estimate before measuring to develop a sense of approximation and improve reasoning skills.    Use appropriate instruments such as thermometers, measuring jugs, or rulers to validate your estimates.    Calculate absolute and percentage errors to evaluate how close your estimates were to the actual values.      Approximating Temperature Using Estimation   A student places their hand on a metal surface that was exposed to sunlight. They estimate the temperature of the surface to be 38°C based on how warm it feels. Later, they use a digital thermometer and record the actual temperature as 41°C. Approximate the absolute and percentage error in the student's estimation.    Estimated temperature = 38°C  Measured temperature = 41°C        Therefore, the estimated temperature was off by 3°C, which is approximately a 7.32% error.       In this section, we learned how to approximate quantities in measurements and understand the concept of error. We practiced estimating lengths, masses, areas, volumes, temperature and time durations using everyday objects and methods. We also calculated absolute and percentage errors to evaluate the accuracy of our estimates.    Determine errors using estimations and actual meaasurements of quantites      Choose an object (e.g., a pencil, an apple, a cup).  Estimate its length, weight, or volume without measuring it using easuring tools.  Now, measure the actual length, weight or volume using a ruler, scale, or measuring cup.  Record both the estimated and measured values.  Calculate the absolute error by subtracting the estimated value from the actual value.  Activity Table Template   Activity Table Template:    Item  Quantity Type  Estimated Value  Measured Value  Absolute Error    Pencil  length (cm)  10 cm      Apple  weight (g)  12      Cup of water  volume (ml)  250 ml                      Discuss the results with your classmates. How close were your estimates to the actual measurements? What factors might have influenced your estimations?     Rank the items from least to greatest relative error.    Predict next time using learned error patterns.    Discuss how professionals (engineers, chefs, scientists) rely on accurate measurements in their work.        Now, repeat the activity with a different object or quantity.  This time, try to improve your estimation skills based on what you learned from the first activity.  Record your new estimates and actual measurements in the same table format.  a) Was your estimate higher or lower than the actual value?  b) Which type of quantity (length, weight, or volume) was easier to estimate? Why?  c) Why is it important to understand error in real-life situations (e.g., cooking, building, shopping)?  d) What can we do to improve our estimation skills?       1. Approximation helps when exact values aren't necessary.  ` 2.All measurements have some error.  3. Estimating quantities is a useful skill in everyday life.  4. Knowing the actual measurement allows you to see how close your estimate was.  5. The absolute error is the difference between the estimated and actual values.  6. Knowing the error helps you see how accurate or inaccurate your result is.   True\/False  Temperature   If the statement correct choose true and if its wrong choose false.     False! Relative error is a percentage, and it depends on the size of the actual value    Relative error is calculated as the absolute error divided by the actual value, and it can be larger than the absolute error if the actual value is small.      Temperature.   If the statement correct choose true and if its wrong choose false.     True!    A good measurement is one that is as close to the true value as possible, minimizing error.      Temperature.      If the statement correct choose true and if its wrong choose false.        False! All measurements are not always 100% accurate, there is always a margin of error.    All measurements have some degree of error due to limitations in tools, human judgment, and environmental factors.      Temperature.      If the statement correct choose true and if its wrong choose false.        True!    Approximation is useful in many situations where exact values are not necessary, such as estimating costs or distances.      Without using a ruler, Jane estimates the length of her English textbook to be 30 cm. She then uses a ruler and finds the actual length is 28.5 cm. Calculate the Absolute Error.             Percentage errror            Ruler or tape measure (for length)    Different weighing scales (for weight\/mass) i.e:   Kitchen scale (for small weights)    measuring cup or jug (for volume)    Stopwatch or timer (for time)       Calculator (for calculations)     Students should rotate through stations where they estimate and then measure quantities and finally calculate the percentage error for each task.

Instructions for each station:  a. Station 1 (Length): Estimate the length of a pencil, then measure it with a ruler. Record both values.  b. Station 2 (Weight): Estimate the weight of a bag of sugar, then weigh it using a kitchen scale. Record both values.  c. Station 3 (Volume): Estimate the volume of water in a cup, then measure it using a measuring cup or jug. Record both values.  d. Station 4 (Time): Estimate how long it takes to complete a task (e.g., jumping 10 times or breathing in deeply and estimating time in seconds you can hold your breathe), then use a stopwatch or timer to measure the actual time. Record both values.  3. At each station:   Estimate the quantity first.    Then they measure it accurately.    Finally, calculate:         4. Groups record their data in a tracking sheet.  5. After rotating through all stations, students return to their seats and reflect.

How did your estimates compare to the actual measurements?    What was the largest percentage error you encountered?    Why might estimating volume or weight be harder than length?    How close were your estimates to the actual measurements?    What factors might have affected your estimates?    How can you improve your estimation skills in the future?         A student estimates the length of a pencil to be 30 cm, but the actual measurement is 28.5 cm.    To find the absolute error and percentage error, we use the formulas:        Therefore, the absolute error is 1.5 cm and the percentage error is approximately 5.26%.      Amina estimates the weight of a bag of flour to be 2 kg, but the actual weight is 1.95 kg. Calculate the flour's pecentage error.    To find the absolute error and percentage error, we use the formulas:        Therefore, the absolute error is 0.05 kg and the percentage error is approximately 2.56%.     "

  "body": " Coordinates and Graphs   Coordinates refers to the position of a point on a Cartesian plane. A point is represented as where \"x\" tells you how far to move left or right, and \"y\" tells you how far to move up or down.    Plotting Out Points on a Cartesian Plane  The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular axes: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis , which intersect at the origin   When plotting points on a Cartesian plane:   If your point is move units right (positive x direction) and units up (positive y direction).    If the point is move units left (negative x direction) and units down (negative y direction).        Work in pairs      Randomly select points (e.g., (2,3), (-4,1), (0,-2)) and plot them on a Cartesian plane.    Exchange your plotted points with another group and discuss.             The axes divide the Cartesian plane into four regions known as quadrants each defined by the x-axis and y-axis and named in an anticlockwise direction:    First Quadrant (Top Right) – Both x and y coordinates are positive (e.g., (3,2)).     Second Quadrant (Top Left) – x is negative, y is positive (e.g., (-4,5)).     Third Quadrant (Bottom Left) – Both x and y coordinates are negative (e.g., (-2,-3)).     Fourth Quadrant (Bottom Right) – x is positive, y is negative (e.g., (6,-1)).           Each quadrant helps categorize points based on their signs, making it useful for graphing equations and solving coordinate geometry problems.  The location of points using the perpendicular axes, that is, x and y axis that meet at right angle, is known as cartesian-coordinate system. The system helps in locating places on the earth surface.    Plot the points on a Cartesian plane.    The correct location of the points based on the x- and y-coordinates on the Cartesian plane is:         Identify and write down the coordinates of the points on the Cartesian plane below.                                   Drawing a Straight Line Graph Given an Equation    Work in groups      Consider the following equation of a line:     Generate a table of values by substituting different x-values: in the equation.                            Plot the points and draw a straight line through them.         Straight-line graph represents: a constant rate of change between two variables.  The structure of the equation of a straight line is: where;    is the slope (rate of change)     is the y-intercept (starting value)       Draw the graph of for     First, generate the table of values for the equation.                    Plot the points on the cartesian plane and draw a line passing through the points as shown.         Drawing Parallel Lines on a Cartesian-plane       Consider the following two equations: and     Generate tables plot the points, and draw the lines for the equations    Compare the lines and discuss why they are parallel.          Parallel lines are lines that never meet and are always the same distance apart.  Parallel lines have the same direction or slope.    Draw the graphs of and     First, generate the table of values for both equations.                                                       Both lines are parallel, clearly shown by their identical slope.      Relating the Gradients of Parallel Lines     Work in pairs      Consider the following equations:     Plot the graph of the equations on a cartesian plane.    Calculate the gradients of the lines and compare them to check whether the lines are parallel.          We can establish whether two or more lines are parallel by calculating and comparing their gradients.  To calculate the gradient (or slope) of a straight line, we use this formula: where and are two distinct points on the line.  Parallel lines have equal gradients.    Find the gradient of the lines. Are the lines parallel?       Calculate the gradient for the line by taking two points in the line:         Calculate the gradient for the second line by taking the points         Notice that the gradients Therefore, parallel lines have the same slope or gradient. You also see that the gradient for the equations is the co-efficient of for the equations.      Drawing Perpendicular Lines on a Cartesian Plane     Work in pairs      Consider the following equations:     Generate tables, plot the points, and draw the lines on a Cartesian plane.    Do the lines intersect? What is the angle of intersection?    Discuss your findings with other learners.          Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a right angle (90°) for example the x- and y-axes on a Cartesian plane, road intersections.    Draw the graphs of and     Generate the table of values for the two equations                                            Draw the two lines:     Using a protractor you can verify that the two lines meet at       Relating the Gradients of Perpendicular Lines       Consider the following equations:     Calculate the gradients of the lines and compare them to check whether the lines are perpendicular.    Multiply the gradients and observe the result.    Plot the graph of the equations on a cartesian plane.    Discuss you results with other learners.          Perpendicular lines have gradients whose product is     Find the gradients of     Generate the table of values for the equations and draw the graph.                                               Calculate the gradient for the line by taking the points         Calculate the gradient for the other line by taking the points         Multiply the gradients: The two line are perpendicular since the product of their gradients is -1.      Applying Graphs of Straight Lines in Real Life Situation  Graphs of straight lines help us visualize and solve problems involving constant change. Whether you're tracking expenses, designing a structure, or analyzing data, linear graphs are powerful tools for making sense of the world.    A printing shop charges a fixed setup fee of KSh 5 and an additional KSh 2 for each page printed. The total cost y (in KSh) for printing x pages is given by the equation: What is the cost of printing:      pages     pages    If a customer has KSh 65, how many pages can they print? Show your working.       First, draw the graph of      From the graph:    pages cost      pages cost      To estimate the number of pages that cost to print, we use our equation:   Since the cost (y) is given as KSh. 65, substitute for y then find x, the number of pages.

  "title": "Scale Drawing",
  "body": " Scale Drawing   Scale drawing is a way of representing real objects or spaces on paper using a fixed ratio—so that large things (like buildings or roads) can be drawn small, but still accurately.  It opens the door to connecting mathematics with the real world in meaningful, visual ways.    Identifying Compass and True Bearings in Real Life Situations   Compass Bearing     Work in groups   You are required to identify directions using compass points (e.g North, East, e.t.c) and relate them to real landmarks around the school.   Materials needed   A simple handheld compass, clipboards or drawing paper, pencils or pens, a basic sketch map of the school grounds (or blank paper to create one).     Set a Reference Point: Choose a central feature like the school flagpole or assembly ground. This will be the reference for all directional observations.    Mark Cardinal Points: Students stand at the reference point. Use the compass to find and mark True North Identify and sketch the main compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc.)    Observe and Record Compass Bearings: From the reference point, each group chooses 3 visible features (e.g. gate, staffroom, classroom door). For each feature, describe the direction using compass points (e.g. \"The gate is SE of the flagpole\").    Map It Out: Sketch a simple compass rose and map out the features in their corresponding directions.    Discuss your findings with other learners. How could compass directions help you give directions without using distances?          Compass bearing gives the direction using the cardinal points and the secodary points of a compass.  The cardinal points are the main points (North(N), East(E), West(W) and South(S)) while the secondary points are: North East(NE), South East(SE), South West(SW) and North West(NW).  The compass bearing is always given as e.t.c where is an acute angle from one cardinal point to the other.    True Bearing     Work in groups   You are required to measure the true bearing of objects from a reference point in degrees (from 0° to 360°).   Materials needed   Protractors, compass, school map or blank paper and clipboards and pencils.     Use the same central location (e.g. flagpole) and using the same 3 landmarks you identified.    Using a protractor, measure the true bearing of each landmark, true bearing is measured clockwise from true North. Record each as a three-figure bearing (e.g. 045°, 270°).    On a sketch map, draw arrows from the origin showing each bearing.          True bearing of one place from another is measured clockwise from true North. It is record as a three-figure bearing (e.g. 005°, 045°, 270°).       Determine the compass bearing of point P from point Q.    Determine the true bearing of point P from point Q.          Draw a compass at the point Q, which is the reference point.  Draw a straigth line connecting the two point and measure the angle formed by the line and the true North of point Q.        P is North East from Q and the and the angle measure is . The compass bearing of Q from P is     The true bearing of point Q from P is           Determining the Bearing of One Point From Another in Real Life Situations     Work in groups    Materials Needed   Compass, clipboards, pencils, school compound map (or blank paper for sketching).     In your groups, choose a starting point within the school compound (e.g., school gate, flagpole, staffroom).    Each group will hoose 3–4 other landmarks around the school.    Use the compass to determine the bearing from their starting point to each landmark.    Record bearings using three-figure notation (e.g., 092°).          Directional information is essential for locating positions accurately in practical contexts like travel, rescue missions, and route planning.    Find the bearing of:     A from C    C from A    C from B    A from B             To find the bearing of point A from C, first draw a compass at the starting point, which is C in this case. Then connect point A to C using a line. Using a compass, measure the angle ( in the clockwise direction) formed by the North line at C and the line AC. Place your compass at C such that the mark lies on the North line. Therefore, A is on a bearing of from C.    Using a similar approach, from the one above, C is on a bearing of from A    C is on a bearing of from B.    A lies directly North of B (A is due North of B). Therefore, A is on a bearing of from B.              Locating a Point Using Bearing and Distance in Real Life Situations     Work in groups    Materials Needed   Compass, measuring tape or meter wheel, clipboards, pencils, school compound map (or blank paper for sketching).     In your groups, choose a starting point within the school compound (e.g., school gate, flagpole, staffroom).    Each group will hoose 3–4 other landmarks around the school.    Use the compass to determine the bearing from their starting point to each landmark.    Measure or estimate the distance between their point and each landmark. Record bearings using three-figure notation (e.g., 072°).    Create a scaled sketch map of the landmarks showing relative positions, distances and bearings.    Each group presents one of their bearings and explain how they measured it. What challenges did you face in this activity? (e.g., compass interference) What are the real-world implications of bearing (e.g., navigation, mapping, aviation).          Bearings and distances is used to accurately determine and plot the location of an object or landmark on a map.    Point P is due west of point Q. Point R is due north of point Q. Point S is due west of R. Using a scale of sketch the given information and answer the following questions:     Determine the bearing of S from P.    Distance PS.       Sketch the given information:     The sketch when drawn to scale of         Use a compass to find the bearing of point S from Q. The bearing of S from P is     Use a ruler to measure the drawing length PS then convert your answer to the actual disatnce using the given scale. The drawing length of PS is Therefore the actual distance will be          Identifying Angles of Elevation in Real Life Situations     Work in groups      Identify Observation Points: Select a tall object around the school compound (e.g. flagpole). Mark three different distances from the object (e.g. 5 m, 10 m, 15 m).    Observe and Record: At each marked point: Look at the top of the object, record the angle at which you tilt your head upward. Note the horizontal distance from the base of the object.    Sketch the Scenario: Draw scaled right-angled triangles showing: The base (horizontal distance), the height of the object (calculate using trigonometry if desired) and the angle when you tilt your head at each position.    Discuss with other learners: How does the angle change as the distance increases?          The angle at which you tilt your head upward when looking at the top of an ojject is known as the angle of elevation.      The angle of elevation is the angle formed between a horizontal line ( Eye-level) and a line of sight when you look upward at an object. For example, when you gaze up at the top of a tree from the ground, the angle your eyes make above the eye-level is the angle of elevation.    Hamadi is flying a kite above his eye level. The horizontal distance between Hamadi and the kite is Using a scale of represent the above information to scale drawing. Measure the angle of elevation.    The sketch will resemble:     The scale drawing of the sketch using the scale of      The angle of elevation is       Determining Angles of Elevation in Different Situations     Work in groups      Each group chooses at least 2 tall objects to observe, such as: A flagpole, a clock on the wall, a school building corner, a distant tree e.t.c.    From a known distance (e.g. 5 m, 7 m, or 10 m) from the base of each object: measure the angle of elevation from your eye level to the top of the object. Record both the horizontal distance and angle.    Groups can choose a different viewing distance for the same object and compare how the angle changes.    Draw scaled right-angled triangles using your measurements. Base = distance from object, Height = unknown (can be estimated using trigonometry if desired) Angle = measured angle of elevation. Label your drawings with the correct scale and features.    Discuss with your fellow learners: How does the angle of elevation change as you move farther away from an object? Why is it useful to know this angle in construction, surveying, or aviation? What would happen if you measured from the top of a hill?          The closer you move towards an object the bigger the angle of elevation. When you move farther away, the angle gets smaller. This concept helps surveyors or engineers estimate heights when they can’t climb structures.”    Amina, a grade 9 student from Makini School is standing 6 meters away from the base of the flagpost. She is viewing the top of the flagpost. Make a scale drawing of the given information using a scale of Determine the angle of elevation and the height of the flagpost given Amina's eye-level is from the ground.    The sketch:     The scale drawing of the information given is:     The height of the flagpost is   The angle of elevation is       Identifying Angles of Depression in Real Life Situations     Work in groups      Identify Observation Points: Find raised platforms around your school — such as a staircase, or balcony — where you can safely observe the ground.    Observation and Measurement: From the elevated spot; Choose three different objects or points below (e.g., a stone, plant bed, frind's shoes). Record the angle at which you tilt your head downward to each object. Record each measurement and the horizontal distance from the base of your observation point to the object.    Sketch simple side-view diagrams showing the horizontal line from their eye level and the line of sight downward. Label each angle using correct notation (e.g., 25°, 40°). Draw a scaled triangle showing horizontal distance, vertical height, and angle.          “When do you find yourself looking downward toward something?” (e.g., looking down at a car from a balcony, watching students below, or spotting a ball on a field).  The angle at which you tilt your head downward to look towards an object is known as angle of depression .        Amani is staring at a garden bench from the window of his room, which is above the ground. The horzontal distance to the bench is Determine the angle of depression.    First use the information to draw the sketch:     First, choose a suitable scale to display the given information. When you choose a scale of The scale drawing representation will be:     From a window 4 meters high, the angle of depression to a garden bench is 30°.      Determining Angles of Depression in Different Situations     Work in groups      Choose an elevated position around your school (like a stairwell or balcony).    Measure and record the vertical height from your eyes to the ground.    Identify objects on the ground (like a rock, a shoe, a plant e.t.c.).    Measure the horizontal distance from the object to the base of the platform. Groups can choose a different viewing distance for the same object and compare how the angle changes.    Draw scaled right-angled triangles using your measurements. Label your drawings with the correct scale and features. Measure the angle of depression using a protractor.    Share your results with other groups and discuss your findings. How does the angle of depression change as you move farther away from or closer to an object?          Imagine you're standing on a balcony looking at an object on the ground:  If the object is very close to the base of the building, your line of sight is steep, creating a larger angle of depression.  As the object moves farther away, your line of sight becomes shallower, resulting in a smaller angle of depression.    Mwema is standing on a -meter-high observation deck and sees a bicycle on the ground meters away from the base of the tower. What is the angle of depression to the bicycle?    First, draw a sketch from the given information     The scale drawing of the above sketch using a scale of is:     From the deck 24 meters high, the angle of depression to the bicycle is       Applying Scale Drawing in Simple Surveying   Surveying is like giving the world a measured sketch so we can understand where things are and how far apart they are.  Surveying is the process of measuring land and spaces to figure out distances, angles, directions, and positions. It helps create maps, plan buildings, roads, bridges, and more.  A field notebook is a small, portable book used by surveyors and even students— to record observations, measurements, sketches, and notes taken while working outside or “in the field.”  The methods used in surveying are:   Using bearing and distance.    Using a base line.       Using Bearing and Distance     Work in groups    Materials Needed   Measuring tapes, graph paper or drawing sheets, rulers and protractors, clipboards and pencils.     Define the Survey Area: Choose a safe, open area like: a section of the schoolyard, the path between classrooms and the field, a rectangular garden or sports court.    Walk the perimeter and measure key dimensions (lengths of paths, distances between trees, classrooms, etc.) Record angles at corners.    Select a suitable scale (e.g., 1 cm = 2 meters or 1:200) depending on the area size and graph paper.    Draw the Scale Map: Translate measurements onto graph paper using your scale and label features (classrooms, field etc.) Use symbols and a key to show real-world features.    Discuss your findings with other learners. What did you find difficult in this activity?          Plotting positions using bearings and distances on a scale map is similar to how surveyors map land features or plan navigation paths.    A team of surveyors is hired to map out the positions of hidden 'treasure markers' on a field. You are given a starting location (the Base Station) and a list of distances and compass bearings to each marker. Use bearings and scaled distances to plot locations on a survey map and discover the hidden treasure!         Target Point  Bearing from A  Distance from A(m)    B      C      D      E        Set up your map scale: You may choose a scale of   Start by marking your Base Station (Point A) near the center of your page.  Use the Bearing and Distance Data Table above to draw the positions of other points (B, C, D, and E) from Point A.  Joining the points B, C, D, and E forms the boundary where the treasure is.   Using Bearing and Distance       Using a Baseline  A baseline, in surveying, is a measured straight line between two fixed points on the ground. It serves as the reference line from which other points are located and measured.     Work in groups    Materials Needed   Measuring tapes, graph paper or drawing sheets, rulers, clipboards and pencils, pegs or sticks to mark points on the field.     Set Up the Baseline:Choose a flat, open area like a playground. Measure and mark a baseline (e.g., 10 meters between Point A and Point B). This will be your reference line.    Identify Target features: From the base line AB, observe and mark other features (like a tree, a rock, classroom, flagpole e.t.c.) from your line of sight.    Connect the targeted feature (e.g tree) to the base line AB using a perpendicular line and record the measurements of the line. Do this for the remaining targeted features.    Make a scale drawing of your findings and share your findings with other learners.          The baseline is used to create scaled geometric representations of land.  The baseline is the backbone of many surveying techniques. It’s a precisely measured straight line on the ground that serves as a reference for locating other points using angles and distances.    The figure below represents a farm drawn to scale ( represents ). Develop a field book.       Use a ruler to measure the lengths and convert them to actual scale.    Base line XY     A to XY     B to XY     C to XY     D to XY     E to XY     F to XY     The information on a field book will be:          Y          To D      To C        To E    To B      To A       X          Appreciating the Use of Scale Drawing in Real Life Situations  Appreciating scale drawing means understanding how it helps us plan, design, and communicate ideas clearly and accurately—turning big ideas into manageable, measurable visuals.     Create a scale drawing of a real or imagined space      Choose a space to design (e.g., your bedroom, classroom, or a dream room).    Measure or estimate the actual dimensions of the space and its furniture.    Select a scale for your drawing. Example:     Draw the layout on the grid below. Include: Walls and boundaries, furniture or features (bed, desk, windows, etc.), labels for each item, a title, scale, and compass direction (N).    Discuss with your fellow learners: What scale did you choose and why? How did using a scale drawing help you plan your space? What challenges did you face while drawing to scale?             Mathematics and Problem Solving: Scale drawings help us solve real-world problems involving area, perimeter, and proportions.    Maps and Navigation: Maps are scale drawings of land, helping us understand distances and directions.     What are other applications of scale drawing?   "

Similar figures have the same shape but may differ in size. We will learn how to determine if two figures are similar and what properties they share.          Gather various objects found around the school.    Organize the items by grouping those with similar shapes.    Explain the reasons why you think the shapes are alike.    Present your findings and explanations to the other groups in the class.               Study the shapes shown below.                                                            Select the shapes that you consider similar and group them together.    State the properties of the shapes that you consider similar.    Share your findings with other groups in the class.        Key Takeaway      Two figures are considered to be similar when their corresponding sides have the same ratio.    In the case of plane shapes, their matching interior angles must also be equal.    When naming similar triangles, list the vertices in a way that shows which angles are equal. For instance, if triangle is similar to triangle , it means angle matches angle , angle matches angle , and angle matches angle .       Determine whether triangle and triangle are similar.             corresponds to , corresponds to , and corresponds to .     Since the ratio of the corresponding sides are equal, we conclude that triangle is similar to triangle .      Determine whether triangle and triangle are similar.                Since is not equal to , the triangles are not similar.

Discuss the properties of the two triangles.    Share the results with other groups in the class.             In similar figures, the corresponding sides are in proportion, and the corresponding angles are equal. The ratio of corresponding sides can serve as a scale factor for creating similar figures.        is a right angled triangle with , , and . Draw another triangle that is similar to triangle with a scale factor of 2.           The expected drawing will be a triangle with sides , , and since the scale factor is .       Corresponding interior angles of the triangles and must be equal, i.e., , , and .             Determining Properties of Enlargement of Different Figures          The figure below shows a rectangle as observed by a learner without a magnifying lens.       The figure below shows the same rectangle as observed by the same learner after using a magnifying lens       The lens is considered to have transformed the rectangle in (1) to give the rectangle in (2). What do you notice?    Identify other real life situations where you have observed this kind of transformation.    Share your results with other groups in the class.             In an enlargement, the object and its image remain similar. The linear scale factor of the enlargement determines the proportional transformation.    Lines connecting object points to their corresponding image points intersect at the center of enlargement. This property helps in determining the center of enlargement when both the object and its image are given.    To determine the scale factor, divide the length of the enlarged image by the corresponding length of the original object.       The figure below shows a triangle and its image after a transformation. Show that this is an enlargement and determine the scale factor of the enlargement.          Join point to , to , and to . Extend the lines connecting the points. The lines connecting the points intersect at a point, which is the center of enlargement.          The ratio of image distances to object distances is constant, which confirms that the transformation is an enlargement with a scale factor of .

  "body": " Trigonometry  Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationship between the angles of a right-angled triangle and the ratios of its sides.  These ratios are known as trigonometric ratios and they include sine, cosine and tangent   Identifying Angles and Sides of Right Angled Triangles          Draw a right-angled triangle and label its vertices as , , and , with the right angle positioned at .    Identify the side that is next to angle , excluding the hypotenuse.    Point out the hypotenuse, the side that lies opposite the ° angle.    Now repeat the same steps, but this time use angle as your reference.             A right-angled triangle always has one angle equal to °. The other two angles must be acute angles    The sides that include the right angle are perpendicular to each other and the third side is called the hypotenuse.    If you are given an angle in a right-angled triangle, the side opposite to that angle is called the opposite side, while the side next to the angle (excluding the hypotenuse) is called the adjacent side as shown below.           The figure below shows a right-angled triangle . Name the sides which are opposite and adjacent to the angle and identify the hypotenuse side.       Side is adjacent to angle .

  "body": " Data Interpretation   By the end of this section, you will be able to:     Define and distinguish between different types of data (primary, secondary, and tertiary).    Identify appropriate data collection methods, including surveys, experiments, and observations.    Organize and present data using frequency distribution tables for both grouped and ungrouped data.    Compute and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) to summarize datasets.    Visualize data effectively through histograms and frequency polygons.    Apply statistical methods to analyze real-world problems and draw meaningful conclusions.       Determining Appropriate Class Width For Grouping Data  Data can be classified mainly into two types on the basis of how it is organized: Grouped Data and Ungrouped Data . Ungrouped data is raw data, which consists of a simple list of values where each value corresponds to a distinct observation or measurement.  For example, a list of marks of students in a classroom (e.g., 95, 94, 96, 92, 98, 99, ...). This kind of representation is used when we have a smaller dataset and need to deal with individual data points.  Grouped data, on the other hand, is a collection of data that has been organized into groups or intervals. This is done to simplify the analysis and interpretation of large datasets. Grouping data helps in identifying patterns, trends, and distributions within the data.  When we have a larger dataset, it is preferable to group similar data values into intervals and assign a value to each interval corresponding to the frequency of data points in that range. The intervals should have a uniform length defined by their upper and lower limits.   Work in Groups:- Measuring Arm Span     You will need a tape measure.    In pairs, measure each other's arm span (from fingertip to fingertip with arms stretched out horizontally) in centimetres. Record the measurements in your exercise books.    Identify the shortest and the longest arm span in your group.    Calculate the difference between the longest and the shortest arm span.    Share your findings with the class—were the tallest students also the ones with the longest arm spans?       Work in Groups:- Temperature  You are provided with the daily afternoon temperatures (in °C) recorded in your area over the last 22 days:    29, 31, 26, 33, 30, 27, 25, 35, 28, 24, 32, 26, 30, 34, 33, 29, 31, 27, 36, 25, 28, 32       Identify the lowest and highest temperatures in the data    Work out the difference between them.    Choose a suitable class width that allows you to divide the temperatures into 5 equal intervals.    Write down the 5 class intervals.    Create a frequency table showing how many days fall into each interval.    Share your findings with your classmates.       width is the size of each interval when grouping data. It is determined by the range of the data and the number of intervals you want to create.  When the data is widely spread out, it is often useful to group the data into intervals. This makes it easier to analyze and interpret the data. The choice of class width is crucial for effective grouping.  The diferrence between the highest and lowest values in a dataset is called the . The range gives you an idea of how spread out the data is.  The lowest number in the class interval is called the , and the highest number is called the . The class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.  To determine an appropriate class width for grouping data, follow these steps:  In the class , the lower limit is and the upper limit is . While the lower class boundary is and the upper class boundary is . The class width is calculated as follows:   Upper class boundary - Lower class boundary = Class width   The range of numbers from smallest to largest in a distribution helps in determining class size as follows: Round up to the next higher whole number if necessary if the result is not a whole number.   Organizing Smartphone Battery Life   The battery life (in hours) of 30 different smartphone models was recorded as follows:  9, 12, 11, 15, 18, 10, 14, 17, 13, 16, 19, 15, 12, 14, 17, 10, 13, 11, 20, 19, 9, 13, 16, 18, 17, 12, 10, 11, 15, 16     What is the shortest and longest battery life recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the battery life data into 6 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The smallest battery life is hours and the longest is hours.    The range of the data is the difference between the longest and shortest battery life:               rounding to nearest whole number gives us a class width of hours.    Therefore, the class intervals are:    Time in Hours  9 - 11  11 - 13  13 - 15  15 - 17  17 - 19  19 - 21          Organising Heights of Students   The heights of 60 students in a class were measured in centimetres and recorded as follows:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210     What is the shortest and heighest height recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the heights into 5 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The shortest height is cm and the highest is cm.                    The class intervals are:    Height (cm)  150 - 161  162 - 173  174 - 185  186 - 197  198 - 210           Drawing Frequency Distribution Tables For Grouped Data   Work in Groups     The numbers of house units in 40 blocks of flats in a certain area are given below:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190    Make a frequency distribution table for the data above, using class intervals of units.    Marks  Tally  Number of House Units    150-157   7    158-165      166-173      174-181      182-189      190-197        Share your frequency distribution table with other learners in the class.      A frequency distribution table is a way of organizing data into classes or groups, so as to make the data more meaningful and easier to analyze.                                  Identifying Modal Class of Grouped Data   Work in Groups.     Below is frequency distributiion table showing the marks of learners in a class out of 100 points.    Marks  Frequency    0-10  0    11-19  0    20-29  1    30-39  3    40-49  1    50-59  3    60-69  23    80-89  15    70-79  15    90-100  9           Key Takeaway   The highest frequency in a distribution is called modal frequency . The class that has the highest is reffered to as the modal class.    Work in Groups     The frequency distribution table below shows the number of children per household in a village.    Households  1-5  6-10  11-15  16-20  21-25  26-30  31-35    Frequency  3  4  6  2  1  3  5       State the modal class of the data.    What is the modal frequency?       Share your findings with the other learners in the class.       Sunshine records      Daily hours of sunshine at 50 weather stations in a country were recorded and the results are shown in the frequency table below.

The modal class is kg, because it has the highest frequency of .    The modal frequency is .         Calculating Mean of Grouped Data   Work in Groups.     The table below shows the marks scored by in an assessment.    Marks  Mid point  Number of Learners ( )  f( )    10 - 22   5  80    23 - 35   10  290    36 - 48   20     49 - 61   30     62 - 74   10     75 - 87   5     88 - 100   1       Total = 81  Total =       Complete the table.    Use the table to determine the mean mark.       Share your work with other learners in the class.       Key Takeaway.   When data is organized into class intervals, each interval is represented by its mid-point , which is the average of the lower and upper boundaries of that class.  Mid-point can be denoted as;      Mean is represented by the symbol , read as bar.  Thus,   The symbol (sigma) means \"sum of\" and is used to indicate that you should add up all the values in the specified range.   Masses of men   The table below shows given masses of men working in a shop. Calculate the mean mass.    Mass (kg)  Mid point    55 - 58  6    59 - 62  8    63 - 66  12    67 - 70  18    71 - 74  6    75 - 78  10    79 - 82  12          Mass (kg)  Mid point  Frequency (f)  fx    55 - 58  56.5  6  339    59 - 62  60.5  8  484    63 - 66  64.5  12  774    67 - 70  68.5  18  1233    71 - 74  72.5  6  435    75 - 78  76.5  10  765    79 - 82  79.5  12  954      Total (f) =  Total (fx) =    The total frequency is and the total of is .  The mean mass is calculated as follows:              Points scored in a tournament   The table below shows the points scored by various teams in a tournament. Calculate the mean points scored.    Points Scored  Frequency    1-10  10    11-20  14    21-30  19    31-40  8    41-50  6    51-60  3      To find the mean points scored, we need to calculate the total points and the total number of teams.    Points Scored  Midpoint  Frequency (f)  fx    1-10   10  55    11-20   14  217    21-30   19  484.5    31-40   8  284    41-50   6  273    51-60   3  166.5      Total =  Total =    The total frequency is and the total of is .  The mean points scored is calculated as follows:               Determining the Median of Grouped Data  Median is a value corresponding to the middlemost data point in a dataset, when arranged in ascending order. The value of median helps one to know about center of a dataset. On comparing the value of median with that of mean, one can get idea of distribution of values in a dataset.  As we have data in form of intervals (classes) in this case, we have a corresponding median class to find the value of median.  Also, we need to define cumulative frequencies for each class, which is a kind of prefix sum of frequencies of classes taken in order. The median value lies between the lower limit and upper limit of the median class. This value can be used by using a specified formula discussed as follows.  To find median of ungrouped data, one can simply sort the data points in ascending order. In case of odd number of observations, the middle value would be the median. On the other hand , for even number of observations, one can take mean of the two middle values to find the median. But there is a different method to find median of grouped data discussed later in this article.   Work in Groups     Consider the data in the frequency distribution table below.    Mass  Class Boundary  Number of People (f)  Cumulative Frequency (cf)  Class Interval (i)     21 - 30  20.5 - 30.5  7  7  7          Median of Grouped Data Formula   We can use the following formula to calculate median of grouped data:     Where:  = Lower limit of the median class  = Width of the median class interval  = Frequency of the median class  = Total frequency  = Cumulative frequency of the class preceding the median class     Sample data   Calculate the value of the median for the following data distribution:    Class Interval  0 - 10  10 - 20  20 - 30  30 - 40  40 - 50    Frequency  5  7  12  10  6      To find the median of given data, we build a table containing cumulative frequencies for each class interval along with the frequencies.    Class Interval  Frequency (f)  Cumulative Frequency (cf)    0 - 10  5  0 + 5 = 5    10 - 20  7  5 + 7 = 12    20 - 30  12  12 + 12 = 24    30 - 40  10  24 + 10 = 34    40 - 50  6  34 + 6 = 40    The total frequency is 40. The median class is the one where the cumulative frequency is greater than or equal to . In this case, the median class is with a cumulative frequency of 24.  Now, we can apply the median formula:   Substituting the values into the formula:   Evaluating the expression:                   The table below shows the mass in kilograms of patients in a hospital ward.    Mass in Kilograms  Frequency (f)    11 - 20  9    21 - 30  14    31 - 40  20    41 - 50  11    51 - 60  6    Calculate the median mass of the patients.    Draw a cumulative frequency table for the data.    Mass in Kilograms  Class boundary  Cumulative frequency  Cumulative frequency (cf)     11 - 20  10.5 - 20.5  9  0 + 9 = 9     21 - 30  20.5 - 30.5  14  9 + 14 = 23     31 - 40  30.5 - 40.5  20  23 + 20 = 43     41 - 50  40.5 - 50.5  11  43 + 11 = 54     51 - 60  50.5 - 60.5  6  54 + 6 = 60     The cumulative frequency for the last class is , which is half of the total frequency. Therefore, the median lies in the class .  To find the median, we use the formula:     Where:    = lower boundary of the median class =  = total frequency =  = cumulative frequency of the class before the median class =  = frequency of the median class =  = class width =    Substituting these values into the formula gives:                  "

  "body": " Probability   Probability refers to the likelihood or chance of an event occurring.  It is a numerical measure that quantifies how likely it is that a specific outcome will happen in a situation with uncertain results.  Probabilities are expressed as numbers between 0 and 1 or as percentages from 0% to 100%.    Introduction to Probability               Each pair of students tosses a coin 20 times.    Record how many times it lands on Heads and how many times on Tails.    Complete a tally table and discuss:   Were the outcomes equal?    Was any outcome more likely?            Understanding probability helps us predict outcomes and make decisions in real life (e.g., weather forecasts, games of chance, insurance, business).    A coin is tossed once. What is the probability of getting a Head?    Sample space = {Head, Tail}  Number of favorable outcomes (Head) = 1  Total outcomes = 2         Range of Probability      Draw a horizontal line labeled from 0 to 1.  Place the following events on the line where you think they belong:   The sun will rise tomorrow    Rolling a 3 on a fair die    Picking a red ball from a bag with 1 red and 9 blue balls    Getting heads on a coin         Probability is written as a number between 0 and 1    = Impossible event     = Event is equally likely to happen or not happen     = Certain event       A bag contains 6 red and 2 blue marbles. What is the probability of drawing a red marble?    Total marbles   Favorable outcomes (red)         This is a likely event, since is closer to 1.      Exclusive Events  Two or more events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time.         Roll a fair die once.    Event A: Getting an even number    Event B: Getting an odd number     Discuss:   Are these events mutually exclusive?    what is          In other words, the occurrence of one event means the other cannot occur.    A bag contains 3 red, 2 blue, and 1 yellow marble. One marble is drawn.  Find the probability of drawing:   A red marble    A yellow marble    A red or yellow marble       Total marbles      Red and yellow are mutually exclusive (you can't pick both at once)            Independent Events  Two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other.         Toss a coin and roll a die at the same time.    Record the outcome (e.g., Heads and 4).    Discuss:   Are these two events independent?    Can the coin toss result affect the die roll?            In other words, the result of one event has no influence on the second event.    A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting heads both times?    First toss:   Second toss:   They are independent, so:            Tree Diagram  A tree diagram is a visual tool used to show all possible outcomes of two or more events, especially when calculating probabilities of combined or successive events.         Construct a tree diagram for tossing a coin twice.    Label the branches with:   First toss: H or T each with     Second toss: H or T again each with        Find the probability of each e.g(P(HH), P(HT))         It helps organize outcomes in branches and is particularly useful for independent events.    A bag has 2 red and 1 green marble. A marble is drawn, replaced, then another is drawn.  Draw a tree diagram and find the probability of getting     Two red marbles    One red and one green (in any order)          Total marbles         Tree Diagram where R = P(Red) and G = P(Green)       P(Red and Red)       (Red then Green)     P(Green then Red)     Total          Application of Probability  Probability helps us make informed decisions in daily life, games, weather forecasting, business, health and risk analysis.         Look at your class register for the past 10 school days.    Count how many days a specific student was present.    Estimate the probability that the student will attend tomorrow.         Probability allows us to predict, estimate risk, and plan ahead based on chance and likelihood.    A weather report says there's a 70% chance of rain tomorrow.  This means the event is not certain, but it is likely.      A study shows that 1 in 4 people are likely to catch a cold during the cold season.              "
