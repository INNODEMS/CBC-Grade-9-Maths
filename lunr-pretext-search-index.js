  "body": " Indices and Logarithms   Indices and logarithms are mathematical concepts that deal with powers and roots of numbers. They are used to simplify calculations involving large numbers and to express relationships between quantities in a more manageable form.  Indices, also known as exponents, represent the number of times a base is multiplied by itself. For example, in the expression , is the base and is the exponent or index. This means that is multiplied by itself times.  Logarithms, on the other hand, are the inverse operation of exponentiation. The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which a base must be raised to produce that number. For example, if , then , where is the base and is the number.    Expressing numbers in index form  Index form means a number written with a base and an exponent (also called index or power).   is the number that is multiplied by itself, and (or index) tells how many times the base is used in the multiplication.  A number in index form is written as , where is the base and is the exponent.     1. Identify the base of the number you want to express in index form.  2. Determine the exponent or index, which is the number of times the base is multiplied by itself to obtain the original number.  3.

Laws of indices   The laws of indices, also known as the laws of exponents, are fundamental rules that govern the manipulation of expressions involving powers or indices. These laws are essential for simplifying calculations and solving equations involving exponential terms. Here are the key laws of indices:  1. : When multiplying two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents: .  2. : When dividing two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents: , where .  3. : When raising an expression with an exponent to another exponent, you multiply the exponents: .  4. : When raising a product to an exponent, you raise each factor to the exponent: .  5. : When raising a quotient to an exponent, you raise both the numerator and denominator to the exponent: , where .  6. : Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is equal to one: , where .  7. : A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent: , where .    Multiplication law of indices    The multiplication law of indices states that when you multiply two numbers with the same base, you add their exponents. This can be expressed mathematically as: , where is the base and and are the exponents.         In groups of , use numbers between and to form at least three pairs of numbers that have the same base but different powers.    Multiply each pair that you have formed.  Example:     Simplify each expression using the multiplication law of indices.    Discuss your work with your fellow learners.         Simplify the following expressions:  a)   b)     a) Since the bases are the same, we can apply the multiplication law of indices:        b) Similarly, for the second expression:            Evaluate:     First, we can multiply the coefficients (the numbers in front):     Next, we apply the multiplication law of indices to the variable :     Combining them we have:   Therefore, .      Division law of indices  The division law of indices states that when you divide two numbers with the same base, you subtract their exponents. This can be expressed mathematically as: , where is the base and and are the exponents.            Using the division law of indices, work with the following pairs of numbers:  i)   ii)   iii)   iv)     For each pair above, form a division expression.

Brackets with indices  Brackets with indices are where we have a term inside a bracket with an index (or power) outside of the bracket.  Example:   In general when there is a term inside a bracket with an index (or power) outside of the bracket multiply the powers.            Working in groups of , consider the following expressions.                                        Recall the bracket law of indices and simplify the expressions above.

When a base is raised to a negative exponent, it indicates that the base should be taken as the reciprocal and then raised to the absolute value of the exponent.  For example, if we have a base and a negative exponent , it can be expressed as: . This means that instead of multiplying by itself times, we take the reciprocal of .  Negative indices are particularly useful in simplifying expressions and solving equations involving powers.

Fractional indices  Fractional indices, also known as rational indices, are used to represent roots of numbers in index form. A fractional index indicates that the base is raised to a power and then the root is taken.  For example, if we have a base and a fractional index , it can be expressed as: .

  "body": " Compound proportions and Rates of work      Consider the numbers and . and . The two ratios are equal . Therefore, these numbers are said to be proportional.  Generally, any numbers and are said to be proportional if:     or      is the amount of work done per unit of time, often expressed as work divided by time     Proportions are everywhere in our daily life, and are very useful. For example, when preparing a meal for many people you would need to increase the amount of ingredients. To do this without altering the taste, you would have to maintain the proportions between various ingredients. They are also important for determining relationships. If you were at a shop and told an item has a discount of sh but you do not know its original price, this would not be useful information. However, if you are instead told it is off, it has a larger effect as you now know the proportion of the new price versus the old price.    Proportional Parts   is an equation in which two ratios are set equal to each other. For example, if and are in the same ratio as and , we can write this as:   .  This means that the fraction is equal to the fraction .  Generally, if an amount is to be divided in the ratio , then the parts will be divided as follows:      will get      will get      will get        Masomo school has a total of Math textbooks, storybooks, and science textbooks.     Working in groups, work out the ratio of Math textbooks to storybooks to science textbooks.    Work out the fraction representing each type of book found in the school.    Explain how you obtained the fractions in (2) above.    Discuss how you would divide the textbooks among students in the ratio of for Math, storybooks, and science textbooks respectively.    Share your work with your fellow learners.         A basket of fruits contains mangoes, oranges, and bananas in the ratio of . If the basket contains fruits in total, how many of each type of fruit are there?    To find the number of each type of fruit, we first calculate the total parts in the ratio: .  Hence number of proportional parts .         What is the value of in     Since can be written as , then to find the value of , we can set up the proportion:   .  Cross-multiplying gives us: .  Simplifying this, we have: .  Dividing both sides by gives us: .  Therefore, the value of is .      Relating different ratios in real life  In real life, we often encounter situations where we need to relate different ratios or rates of work. For example, if James a Grade student can complete a math problem in a minutes, and Esther also a Grade learner completes the same task in minutes, we can express their work rates as ratios. By understanding these ratios, we can determine how long it will take for them to complete the task together or how their individual contributions compare.  Consider the numbers and . You may notice that each number is equal to the previous number multiplied by . The numbers are therefore said to be in continued proportion.  Generally, if numbers, and are in continued proportion:     Since then      If numbers are in continued proportion, they form a geometric progression since they have a common ratio.    Mr Kamboi, a Grade teacher, organized for a short distance race. The race had stations that is station , , , and .  The distance between the stations is as follows:    Station  Position in (m)    A  0    B  20    C  40    D  80    E  160    1. In groups of , draw a diagram to represent the stations and the distances between them.  2.If the distance between the stations is in continued proportion, find the distance between station and , and , and , and and .  3. Identify any proportional relationships between the distance AB and CD and the distance BC and DE.  4. Work out the ratio of AB:BC and CD:DE in simplest form.  5. Share your findings with the class.      If the ratio of the ages of John and Mary is , and the ratio of their ages in years will be , what are their current ages?    Let John's current age be and Mary's current age be .  In years, John's age will be and Mary's age will be .  According to the problem, we have:     Cross-multiplying gives us:     Simplifying this, we have:     Rearranging gives us:     Therefore, John's current age is:   , and Mary's current age is: .      Given that the ratio , find the ratio     We start with the given ratio . This means we can express and in terms of a common variable, say :     Now, we need to find the ratio . Substituting the values of and gives us:     Therefore, the ratio becomes:     Simplifying this ratio, we can cancel out (assuming ):     Therefore, the ratio simplifies to .        If and are in continued proportion, find the value of .    If and are in continued proportion, then we can express this relationship as:     Cross-multiplying gives us:     Simplifying this, we have:     Hence          Working out compound proportions using the ratio method  Two quantities in compound proportion increases or decreases in the same ratio.  To work out compound proportions using the ratio method, you can follow these steps:  1. Identify the two ratios you want to compare or relate.  2. Set up a proportion by equating the two ratios.  3. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.  4. Solve for the unknown variable, if applicable.  5. Check your solution by substituting back into the original ratios to ensure they are equal.  For example, if you have the ratios and , you can set up the proportion as follows:     Cross-multiplying gives you , which simplifies to . This confirms that the two ratios are equivalent.      1. In groups of , measure the length and width of the following trianngles, A and B, using a ruler.       2. Record the measurements of the lengths and widths of triangle A and triangle B.  3. Calculate the ratio of the lengths and widths of triangle A to triangle B.  Example: length ratio = .  4. Compare the two ratios. What do you notice about the relationship between the two triangles?  5. Share your work with your fellow learners.      A class has girls and boys. More students are admitted to the class such that the ratio of girls to boys remain th same.  The new number of boys in the class is now . Determine the new number of girls in the class using the ratio method.    The initial ratio of girls to boys is , which simplifies to .  Let the number of girls after admission be .  Therefore, setting up the proportion we have:     Hence,   Now, cross-multiplying to solve for :           So, the new number of girls in the class is .      Kipngetich measured the heights of a mango tree and a person standing under the tree in a photo. Their heights in the photo were cm and cm respectively. He observed that the ratio of their actual heights is the same as that in the photo. Determine the actual height of the mango tree if the actual height of the person is meters.    The ratio of the heights in the photo is , which simplifies to .  Let the actual height of the mango tree be meters.  Given:  The actual height of the person is meters.  So, the actual height ratio is:   Setting up the proportion, we have:     Cross-multiplying gives us:      meters.        Rates of work  The rate of work is a measure of how quickly work is done or how much work is completed in a given amount of time. It is often expressed as the amount of work done per unit of time, such as hours, days, or weeks.  When dealing with rates of work, the key is to find out how much work a person\/thing can do in one hour, one day, or any other time unit.         - Sticks or stones ( in number)  - Markers or chalk to draw a start point (where the participants will start picking the sticks or stones) and a drop zone (where they will place the picked sticks or stones).  - A watch to measure the time taken.  - Book and pen to record the results.     Outside your classroom, form groups, A and B.    Mark a start point and a drop zone for each group such that the distance between the start point and the drop zone is metres.    One volunteer from each group will pick up the sticks or stones from the start point and place them in the drop zone. Each start point will have sticks or stones.    The volunteer will start picking the sticks or stones at the same time as the group members starts the watch.    The volunteers will pick one stick or stone at a time and place it in the drop zone. They will continue this until all the sticks or stones are picked.    The group members will stop the watch when the volunteer has placed all the sticks or stones in the drop zone. Group members of group A and B will record the time taken by volunteer from their group to pick all the sticks or stones.    Repeat the activity with volunteers from each group.The volunteers will take turns picking the sticks or stones.    The volunteer from each group will drop the stick or stone in the drop zone and return to tag the next volunteer in the line till the last stick is picked while the group members record the total time taken by volunteers to complete the task.    Go back to your groups and find the average time taken by person to complete the task and the rate of work.  Find also the average time taken by volunteers to complete the task and the rate of work.    Share your findings with the other group.         A group of workers can complete a task in hours. If they work at the same rate, how long will it take them to complete the same task if they double their effort?     If the group of workers can complete a task in hours, doubling their effort means they will work twice as fast.  Therefore, the time taken to complete the same task when they double their effort will be half of hours.     So, it will take them hours to complete the same task if they double their effort.      A factory produces units of a product in hours. If the factory increases its production rate by , how many units will it produce in hours?    The factory's current production rate is units in hours, which means it produces units per hour.  If the factory increases its production rate by , the new production rate will be:     Now, to find out how many units the factory will produce in hours at the new production rate:     Therefore, the factory will produce units in hours after increasing its production rate by .      Mary, John and Essy did a piece of work in hours, hours and hours respectively. How long can John take to complete the work when he starts after Mary and Essy have worked for hours each?    First, we need to find out the amount of work done by Mary, John, and Essy in one hour.  The work done by each person in one hour is:           Therefore, the amount of work Mary and Essy will do in hour is:        For hours, Mary and Essy will have done:     The remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for hours is:     Hence, to find out how long it will take John to complete the remaining work, we can use his rate of work:        Therefore, John will take approximately hours to complete the remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for hours each.

Think of the gentle incline of a ramp at your school, or the varying steepness of a hill on a familiar route. These everyday features are examples of what we call a .  Instead of focusing on the mathematics immediately, it is important to understand that the gradient describes how steep a path is—in other words, it tells us how quickly something rises or falls over a certain distance.  In practical terms, this concept is useful in planning safe ramps, roads, or even understanding the effort required to climb a hill.      Materials Required:    Measuring tape or ruler  Notebook and pencil  Calculator (optional)         Walk around your school and identify at least two sloped surfaces (for example, a ramp near a doorway or a sloping walkway).  Observe and discuss with your group what “steepness” might mean in a real-life context. Is a gently inclined ramp different from a steep staircase?  Using a measuring tape, estimate the change in height (how much the surface rises) and the horizontal distance (how far it extends).  Record your observations in a table.

To express its steepness numerically, we use the concept of the gradient, often calculated as:     Thus, for this ramp:     This numerical value, , indicates that for every 1 metre along the ramp, the height increases by 0.3 m.       The gradient gives a numerical value to the concept of steepness, allowing us to compare different slopes and understand their practical implications for safety, accessibility, and design.    "

In this topic, we’re unlocking money secrets from world currencies and currency exchange to taxes, profits and why chocolate sometimes costs more than chips! It’s maths, but with a global twist, let’s make sense of shillings, dollars, euros and maybe even learn something about currency exchange from one country to the next.    Currencies used in different countries.      In this activity, you will learn about the various currencies used in different countries around the world. Understanding global currencies is essential for international travel, online shopping, and global finance.  Materials needed: Use textbooks, internet resources, or currency charts to find the official currencies of at least 10 different countries.  Objective: By the end of this activity, you will be able to identify the official currency of various countries, understand their symbols, and recognize their significance in global trade and economics.  1. Research and Collect Images of Currencies.  Internet Search: Use search engines like Google Images or Bing Images.  Search for East African Countries like:     Kenyan Shilling notes    Ugandan Shilling notes    Tanzanian Shilling notes    Somali Shilling notes    Rwanandan Franc notes    Burundian Franc notes    South Sudanese Pound notes    Ethiopian Birr notes    Eritrean Nakfa notes     Main Currencies we have in East Africa are:  Shilling (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia)  Franc (Rwanda, Burundi)  Pound (South Sudan)  Birr (Ethiopia)  Nakfa (Eritrea)  Other Global Currencies include:  Euro (EUR) - European Union  US Dollar (USD) - United States  British Pound (GBP) - United Kingdom  Japanese Yen (JPY) - Japan  Chinese Yuan (CNY) - China  Indian Rupee (INR) - India  south African Rand (ZAR) - South Africa  Canadian Dollar (CAD) - Canada  Australian Dollar (AUD) - Australia  Swiss Franc (CHF) - Switzerland  Brazilian Real (BRL) - Brazil  Russian Ruble (RUB) - Russia  Mexican Peso (MXN) - Mexico etc...

China    The symbol ¥ is also used for the Chinese Yuan, but it is more commonly associated with Japan.      The correct answer is Japan and China.     Select the correct answer   2.The symbol ¥ represents the currency of which country?      KES      KSh      KS      K$      The correct answer is KSh.     Select the correct answer   4. Which of the following countries uses the Euro (€) as its currency?      Kenya    The Kenyan Shilling is the official currency of Kenya, not the Euro.      France    France is a member of the Eurozone and uses the Euro (€) as its official currency.      Nigeria    The Nigerian Naira (₦) is the official currency of Nigeria, not the Euro.      European Union    The Euro (€) is the official currency of many countries in the European Union, not just France.      The correct answer is France and European Union.      Amina from Kenya wants to buy a mobile phone from the United States.     In Kenya, she uses Kenyan Shillings (KSh).    In the United States, people use US Dollars ($).    To buy the phone, Amina needs to exchange her Kenyan Shillings for US Dollars.    This is because each country uses its own currency for buying and selling goods and services.    Why?       Different countries use different currencies to manage their own economies and trade with other countries.      John from Uganda wants to visit Tanzania for a holiday.     In Uganda, he uses Ugandan Shillings (UGX).    In Tanzania, people use Tanzanian Shillings (TZS).    When John arrives in Tanzania, he cannot use Ugandan Shillings to pay for food or transport.    He has to exchange his Ugandan Shillings for Tanzanian Shillings at a bank or forex bureau.    Why?       1. Because each country has its own money system, and people in Tanzania only accept Tanzanian Shillings for payment.  2. This is because each country has its own currency for transactions.     Matching Question    Match the country with its currency:         Kenya Shilling  Germany    Ugandan Shilling  United States    Canadian Dollar  Tanzania    Tanzanian Shilling  Kenya    Japanese Yen  Canada    US Dollar  Uganda    Pound Sterling  Japan      "

  "body": " Coordinates and Graphs   Plotting Out Points on a Cartesian Plane  The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular axes: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis , which intersect at the origin   Coordinates refers to the position of a point on a Cartesian plane. A point is represented as where \"x\" tells you how far to move left or right, and \"y\" tells you how far to move up or down.  When plotting points on a Cartesian plane:   If your point is move units right (positive x direction) and units up (positive y direction).    If the point is move units left (negative x direction) and units down (negative y direction).        Work in pairs   Randomly select points (e.g., (2,3), (-4,1), (0,-2)) and plot them on a Cartesian plane.  Exchange your plotted points with another group and discuss.     Key Takeaway      The axes divide the Cartesian plane into four regions known as quadrants each defined by the x-axis and y-axis and named in an anticlockwise direction:    First Quadrant (Top Right) – Both x and y coordinates are positive (e.g., (3,2)).     Second Quadrant (Top Left) – x is negative, y is positive (e.g., (-4,5)).     Third Quadrant (Bottom Left) – Both x and y coordinates are negative (e.g., (-2,-3)).     Fourth Quadrant (Bottom Right) – x is positive, y is negative (e.g., (6,-1)).           Each quadrant helps categorize points based on their signs, making it useful for graphing equations and solving coordinate geometry problems.  The location of points using the perpendicular axes, that is, x and y axis that meet at right angle, is known as cartesian-coordinate system. The system helps in locating places on the earth surface.    Plot the points on a Cartesian plane.    The correct location of the points based on the x- and y-coordinates on the Cartesian plane is:         Identify and write down the coordinates of the points on the Cartesian plane below.                                   Drawing a Straight Line Graph Given an Equation    Work in groups   Consider the following equation of a line:   Generate a table of values by substituting different x-values: in the equation.                    Plot the points and draw a straight line through them.     Draw the graph of for     First, generate the table of values for the equation.                    Plot the points on the cartesian plane and draw a line passing through the points as shown.         Drawing Parallel Lines on a Cartesian-plane    Consider the following two equations: and   Generate tables plot the points, and draw the lines for the equations.  Compare the lines and discuss why they are parallel.

  "body": " Data Interpretation   By the end of this section, you will be able to:     Define and distinguish between different types of data (primary, secondary, and tertiary).    Identify appropriate data collection methods, including surveys, experiments, and observations.    Organize and present data using frequency distribution tables for both grouped and ungrouped data.    Compute and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) to summarize datasets.    Visualize data effectively through histograms and frequency polygons.    Apply statistical methods to analyze real-world problems and draw meaningful conclusions.       Determining Appropriate Class Width For Grouping Data   Work in Groups:- Measuring Arm Span     You will need a tape measure.    In pairs, measure each other's arm span (from fingertip to fingertip with arms stretched out horizontally) in centimetres. Record the measurements in your exercise books.    Identify the shortest and the longest arm span in your group.    Calculate the difference between the longest and the shortest arm span.    Share your findings with the class—were the tallest students also the ones with the longest arm spans?       Work in Groups:- Temperature  You are provided with the daily afternoon temperatures (in °C) recorded in your area over the last 22 days:   29, 31, 26, 33, 30, 27, 25, 35, 28, 24, 32, 26, 30, 34, 33, 29, 31, 27, 36, 25, 28, 32      Identify the lowest and highest temperatures in the data    Work out the difference between them.    Choose a suitable class width that allows you to divide the temperatures into 5 equal intervals.    Write down the 5 class intervals.    Create a frequency table showing how many days fall into each interval.    Share your findings with your classmates.       width is the size of each interval when grouping data. It is determined by the range of the data and the number of intervals you want to create.  When the data is widely spread out, it is often useful to group the data into intervals. This makes it easier to analyze and interpret the data. The choice of class width is crucial for effective grouping.  The diferrence between the highest and lowest values in a dataset is called the . The range gives you an idea of how spread out the data is.  The lowest number in the class interval is called the , and the highest number is called the . The class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.  To determine an appropriate class width for grouping data, follow these steps:  In the class , the lower limit is and the upper limit is . While the lower class boundary is and the upper class boundary is . The class width is calculated as follows:   Upper class boundary - Lower class boundary = Class width   The range of numbers from smallest to largest in a distribution helps in determining class size as follows: Round up to the next higher whole number if necessary if the result is not a whole number.   Organizing Smartphone Battery Life   The battery life (in hours) of 30 different smartphone models was recorded as follows:  9, 12, 11, 15, 18, 10, 14, 17, 13, 16, 19, 15, 12, 14, 17, 10, 13, 11, 20, 19, 9, 13, 16, 18, 17, 12, 10, 11, 15, 16     What is the shortest and longest battery life recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the battery life data into 6 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The smallest battery life is hours and the longest is hours.    The range of the data is the difference between the longest and shortest battery life:               rounding to nearest whole number gives us a class width of hours.    Therefore, the class intervals are:    Time in Hours  9 - 11  11 - 13  13 - 15  15 - 17  17 - 19  19 - 21          Organising Heights of Students   The heights of 60 students in a class were measured in centimetres and recorded as follows:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210     What is the shortest and heighest height recorded?    Find the range of the data.    Choose a class width that allows you to sort the heights into 5 equal intervals.    Write out the class intervals.          The shortest height is cm and the highest is cm.                    The class intervals are:    Height (cm)  150 - 161  162 - 173  174 - 185  186 - 197  198 - 210           Drawing Frequency Distribution Tables For Grouped Data.   Work in Groups     The numbers of house units in 40 blocks of flats in a certain area are given below:  150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190    Make a frequency distribution table for the data above, using class intervals of units.    Marks  Tally  Number of House Units    150-157   7    158-165      166-173      174-181      182-189      190-197        Share your frequency distribution table with other learners in the class.      A frequency distribution table is a way of organizing data into classes or groups, so as to make the data more meaningful and easier to analyze.
