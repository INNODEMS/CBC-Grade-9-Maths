                Consider the following two equations:
                <m>y = 2x + 3 </m> and <m>y = 2x - 4.</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Generate tables plot the points, and draw the lines for the equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compare the lines and discuss why they are parallel.
