                            Choose an elevated position around your school (like a stairwell or balcony).

                            Measure and record the vertical height from your eyes to the ground.

                            Identify  objects on the ground (like a rock, a shoe, a plant e.t.c.).

                            Measure the horizontal distance from the object to the base of the platform.
                             Groups can choose a different viewing distance for the same object and compare how the angle changes.

                            Draw scaled right-angled triangles using your measurements. Label your drawings with the correct scale and features. 
                            Measure the angle of depression using a protractor.

                           farther away from or closer to an object?

    <p>
        Imagine you're standing on a balcony looking at an object on the ground:
    </p>
    <p>
        If the object is very close to the base of the building, your line of sight is steep, creating a larger angle of depression.
    </p>
    <p>       
        As the object moves farther away, your line of sight becomes shallower, resulting in a smaller angle of depression.

            <p>
                Mwema is standing on a <m>24</m>-meter-high observation deck and sees a bicycle on the ground <m>50</m> meters away from the base of the tower.
                 What is the angle of depression to the bicycle?
