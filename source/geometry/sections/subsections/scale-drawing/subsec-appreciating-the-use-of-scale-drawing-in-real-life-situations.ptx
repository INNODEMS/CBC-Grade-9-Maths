    <title>Appreciating the Use of Scale Drawing in Real Life Situations</title>
    <p>
        Appreciating scale drawing means understanding how it helps us plan, design, and communicate ideas clearly and accuratelyâ€”turning
         big ideas into manageable, measurable visuals.

                            Select a scale for your drawing. Example: <m>\text{1 cm on paper} = \text{0.5 meters in real life}</m>

                            Draw the layout on the grid below. Include: Walls and boundaries, furniture or features (bed, desk, windows, etc.), 
                            labels for each item, a title, scale, and compass direction (N).

                            Discuss with your fellow learners: What scale did you choose and why?  
                            How did using a scale drawing help you plan your space? 
                            What challenges did you face while drawing to scale?
