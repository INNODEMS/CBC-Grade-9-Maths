                            Identify Observation Points: Find raised platforms around your school — such as a staircase, or balcony
                             — where you can safely observe the ground.

                             Observation and Measurement: From the elevated spot; Choose three different objects or points below 
                             (e.g., a stone, plant bed, frind's shoes). Record the angle at which you tilt your head downward to each object.
                              Record each measurement and the horizontal distance from the base of your observation point to the object.

                            Sketch simple side-view diagrams showing the horizontal line from their eye level and the line of sight downward.
                             Label each angle using correct notation (e.g., 25°, 40°). Draw a scaled triangle showing horizontal distance, vertical height, and angle.

       “When do you find yourself looking downward toward something?” (e.g., looking down at a car from a balcony, watching students below, or spotting a ball on a field). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The angle at which you tilt your head downward to look towards an object is known as <term>angle of depression <m>(\theta)</m>.</term>
