    <title>Applying Scale Drawing in Simple Surveying</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Surveying is like giving the world a measured sketch so we can understand where things are and how far apart they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surveying is the process of measuring land and spaces to figure out distances, angles, directions, and positions. 
            It helps create maps, plan buildings, roads, bridges, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            A field notebook is a small, portable book used by surveyors and even students— to record observations, 
            measurements, sketches, and notes taken while working outside or “in the field.”
        </p>

            The methods used in surveying are:

    <p>
        Plotting positions using bearings and distances on a scale map is similar to how surveyors map land features or plan navigation paths.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A team of surveyors is hired to map out the positions of hidden 'treasure markers' on a field.
                 You are given a starting location (the Base Station) and a list of distances and compass bearings to each marker.
                   Use bearings and scaled distances to plot locations on a survey map and discover the hidden treasure!

        <title>Using a Baseline</title>
        <p>
            A baseline, in surveying, is a measured straight line between two fixed points on the ground. 
            It serves as the reference line from which other points are located and measured.

            The baseline is used to create scaled geometric representations of land.
        </p>
        <p>
            The baseline is the backbone of many surveying techniques. It’s a precisely measured straight line on the ground that 
            serves as a reference for locating other points using angles and distances.
