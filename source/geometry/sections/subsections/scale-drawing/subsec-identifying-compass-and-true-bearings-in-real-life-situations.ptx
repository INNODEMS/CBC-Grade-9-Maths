                You are required to identify directions using compass points (e.g North, East, e.t.c) and relate them to real landmarks around the school.

                            This will be the reference for all directional observations.

                             For each feature, describe the direction using compass points (e.g. "The gate is SE of the flagpole").

    <p>
        Compass bearing gives the direction using the <term>cardinal points</term> and the <term>secodary points</term> of a compass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cardinal points are the main points (North(N), East(E), West(W) and South(S)) while the secondary points are: North East(NE), South East(SE), 
        South West(SW) and North West(NW).
    </p>
    <p>
        The compass bearing is always given as <m>N\theta^\circ E, \, S\theta^\circ W</m> e.t.c where <m>\theta^\circ</m> is an acute angle from one cardinal point to the other.

        </p>
        <p>
            True bearing of one place from another is measured clockwise from true North. It is record as a three-figure bearing (e.g. 005°, 045°, 270°).
