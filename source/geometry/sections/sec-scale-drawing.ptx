    <title>Scale Drawing</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Scale drawing is a way of representing real objects or spaces on paper using a fixed ratioâ€”so that large things
             (like buildings or roads) can be drawn small, but still accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
            It opens the door to connecting mathematics with the real world in meaningful, visual ways.
