    <title>Trigonometry</title>

    <p>
        Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationship between the angles of a right-angled triangle and the ratios of its sides.
    </p>

    <p>
        These ratios are known as trigonometric ratios and they include sine, cosine and tangent
