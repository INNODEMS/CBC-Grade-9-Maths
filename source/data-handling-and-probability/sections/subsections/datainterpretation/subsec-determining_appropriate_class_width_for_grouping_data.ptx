    <title>Determining Appropriate Class Width For Grouping Data</title>

    <p>
        Data can be classified mainly into two types on the basis of how it is organized: <term><em>Grouped Data</em></term> and <term><em>Ungrouped Data</em></term>.
        Ungrouped data is raw data, which consists of a simple list of values where each value corresponds to a distinct observation or measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a list of marks of students in a classroom (e.g., 95, 94, 96, 92, 98, 99, ...).
        This kind of representation is used when we have a smaller dataset and need to deal with individual data points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grouped data, on the other hand, is a collection of data that has been organized into groups or intervals.
        This is done to simplify the analysis and interpretation of large datasets.
        Grouping data helps in identifying patterns, trends, and distributions within the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have a larger dataset, it is preferable to group similar data values into intervals and assign a value to each interval corresponding to the frequency of data points in that range.
        The intervals should have a uniform length defined by their upper and lower limits.

        <m>\textbf{Class}</m> width is the size of each interval when grouping data. 
        It is determined by the range of the data and the number of intervals you want to create.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the data is widely spread out, it is often useful to group the data into intervals. 
        This makes it easier to analyze and interpret the data. 
        The choice of class width is crucial for effective grouping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The diferrence between the highest and lowest values in a dataset is called the <m>\textbf{range}</m>.
        The range gives you an idea of how spread out the data is.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lowest number in the class interval is called the <m>\textbf{lower class boundary} \, \text{or} \, \textbf{lower class limit}</m>,
        and the highest number is called the <m>\textbf{upper class boundary} \, \text{or} \, \textbf{upper class limit}</m>.
        The class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine an appropriate class width for grouping data, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <p>
        In the class <m>12-15</m>, the lower limit is <m>12</m> and the upper limit is <m>15</m>.
        While the lower class boundary is <m>11.5</m> and the upper class boundary is <m>15.5</m>.
        The class width is calculated as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Upper class boundary - Lower class boundary = Class width
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        The range of numbers from smallest to largest in a distribution helps in determining class size as follows:
        <me>
            \text{Class width} = \frac{\text{Range}}{\text{Number of classes expected}}
        </me>
        Round up to the next higher whole number if necessary if the result is not a whole number.
