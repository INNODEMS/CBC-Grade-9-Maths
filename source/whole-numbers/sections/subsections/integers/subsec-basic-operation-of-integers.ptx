            Basic operation of integers is either addition, subtraction, addition,
            division and multiplication.

        <p>
            Addition is losely defined as putting together. 
            In addition, adding a positive and positive, gives a positive.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example is <m>2+4=6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            While adding a positive to a negative, the result and the sign
            may varry depending on the presidence of a negative or positive sign.

        <p>
            Subtraction is deducting one number from the other. For instance, if Olivia had
            10 sweets then she ate 3, she remains with 7.
        </p>
        <p>
            In subtraction a negative and a negative, gives a negative result. 
            While a positive and a negative gives a negative result.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example <m>-2-10=-12</m> and <m>3-9=-6</m>
