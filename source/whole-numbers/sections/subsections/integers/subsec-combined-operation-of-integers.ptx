        <title>Mixed operation of integers</title>
        <p>
         In mixed operation of integers, the four basic operations
         of addition,subtraction,multiplication and division are carried
         out in the same question. Below is an example
        </p>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Victoria had 12 boxes each containing 10 apples. She gave 6 apples to  
                    her friends.She decided to pack the remaining apples in 2 boxes, how
                    many apples will be contained in each box?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    <md>
                        <mrow> 1\, \text{box} =\amp 10\, \text{apples} </mrow>
                        <mrow> 12\, \text{boxes}=\amp ? </mrow>
                        <mrow>12 \times 10=\amp 120 </mrow>
                    </md> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the 120 apples, she gave 6 to her friends, <m>120-6=114 \text{apples}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When division is carried out, <m>114 \div 2=57 \text{apples} </m>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
