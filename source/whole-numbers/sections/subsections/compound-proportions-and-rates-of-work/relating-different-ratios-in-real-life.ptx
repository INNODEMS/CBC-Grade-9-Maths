    <title>Relating different ratios in real life</title>
    <p>
        In real life, we often encounter situations where we need to relate different ratios or rates of work.
         For example, if James a Grade <m>9</m> student can complete a math problem in a <m>5</m> minutes, and Esther also a Grade <m>10</m> learner completes the same task in <m>4</m> minutes, we can express their work rates as ratios.
         By understanding these ratios, we can determine how long it will take for them to complete the task together or how their individual contributions compare.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the numbers <m>3, 6, 12</m> and <m>24</m>. You may notice that each number is equal to the previous number multiplied by <m>2</m>. 
        The <m>4</m> numbers are therefore said to be in continued proportion.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, if <m>4</m> numbers, <m>a, b, c</m> and <m>d</m> are in continued proportion:
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{c}{d}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since <m>\frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c},</m> then <m> b^2 = ac</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>b = \pm \sqrt{ac} </m>
    </p>
    <p>
        If numbers are in continued proportion, they form a geometric progression since they have a common ratio.

                Mr Kamboi, a Grade <m>9</m> teacher, organized for a short distance race. The race had <m>5</m> stations that is station <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, <m>D</m> and <m>E</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distance between the stations is as follows:

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                If the ratio of the ages of John and Mary is <m>3:4</m>, and the ratio of their ages in <m>5</m> years will be <m>4:5</m>, what are their current ages?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Let John's current age be <m>3x</m> and Mary's current age be <m>4x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <m>5</m> years, John's age will be <m>3x + 5</m> and Mary's age will be <m>4x + 5</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the problem, we have:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{3x + 5}{4x + 5} = \frac{4}{5}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cross-multiplying gives us:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>5(3x + 5) = 4(4x + 5)</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplifying this, we have:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>15x + 25 = 16x + 20</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Rearranging gives us:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>x = 5</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, John's current age is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md><mrow>3 \times 5 = 15</mrow></md>,
                 and Mary's current age is:
                 <md><mrow>4 \times 5 = 20</mrow></md>.
            </p>

        </solution>

    </example>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Given that the ratio <m>x:y=2:3</m>, find the ratio <m>(5x−2y):(x+y)</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We start with the given ratio <m>x:y=2:3</m>. This means we can express <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of a common variable, say <m>k</m>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>x = 2k</mrow>
                    <mrow>y = 3k</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we need to find the ratio <m>(5x−2y):(x+y)</m>. Substituting the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> gives us:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>5x - 2y = 5(2k) - 2(3k) = 10k - 6k = 4k</mrow>
                    <mrow>x + y = 2k + 3k = 5k</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the ratio becomes:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>(5x−2y):(x+y) = 4k:5k</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplifying this ratio, we can cancel out <m>k</m> (assuming <m>k ≠ 0</m>):
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>4:5</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the ratio <m>(5x−2y):(x+y)</m> simplifies to <m>4:5</m>.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                If <m>22, X</m> and <m>88</m> are in continued proportion, then we can express this relationship as:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{22}{X} = \frac{X}{88}</mrow>

            </p>
            <p>
                Cross-multiplying gives us:

            <p>
                Simplifying this, we have:
