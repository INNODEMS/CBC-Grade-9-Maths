                The rate of work is a measure of how quickly work is done or how much work is completed in a given amount of time.
                It is often expressed as the amount of work done per unit of time, such as hours, days, or weeks.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <p>
        <alert>Key Takeaway</alert>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> To solve work-rate problems, first determine how much work is completed in a single unit of time (such as one hour or one day).  
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> The rate of work is given by:  
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\text{Rate of work} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}}</m>  
    </p>

    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A group of workers can complete a task in <m>8</m> hours. If they work at the same rate, how long will it take them to complete the same task if they double their effort?
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            Let the whole task be <m>1</m> unit of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Original rate:

        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\text{rate}=\frac{1}{8}\ \text{task per hour}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Doubling effort doubles the rate:
           <me></me>
            <me>\text{new rate}=2\!\times\!\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{4}\ \text{task per hour}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Time = work รท rate:
        <me></me>
            <me>\text{time}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}}=4\ \text{hours}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, it will take <m>4</m> hours.
        </p>
    </solution>
</example>

   <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A factory produces <m>100</m> units of a product in <m>5</m> hours.
                If the factory increases its production rate by <m>20%</m>, how many units will it produce in <m>5</m> hours?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>First, find the current rate.
            <me></me>
                <me>\text{Rate}=\frac{100}{5}= 20 \ \text{units/hour}</me>
            </p>

            <p>Next, increase rate by <m>20\%</m>.
            <me></me>
                <me>\text{New rate}=20+(0.20\times 20)= 24 \ \text{units/hour}</me>
            </p>

            <p>Finally, find production in <m>5</m> hours.
            <me></me>
                <me>\text{Units}=24\times 5= 120</me>
            </p>

            <p>Therefore, the factory will produce <m>120</m> units in <m>5</m> hours.</p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Mary, John and Essy did a piece of work in <m>45</m> hours, <m>40</m> hours and <m>30</m> hours respectively.
                How long can John take to complete the work when he starts after Mary and Essy have worked for <m>13</m> hours each?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The work done by each person in one hour is given as follows:
                <me>\text{Mary's rate} = \tfrac{1}{45}, \quad \text{John's rate} = \tfrac{1}{40}, \quad \text{Essy's rate} = \tfrac{1}{30}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The combined rate of Mary and Essy is:
                <me>\frac{1}{45} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{5}{90} = \frac{1}{18}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                In <m>13</m> hours, Mary and Essy together will complete:
                <me>13 \times \frac{1}{18} = \frac{13}{18}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The remaining portion of work is therefore:
                <me>1 - \frac{13}{18} = \frac{5}{18}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                To finish this, John working alone will take:
                
                <md>
                    <mrow> \text{Time taken by John} =\amp \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{John's rate}}</mrow>  
                    <mrow> \frac{\frac{5}{18}}{\frac{1}{40}} =\amp \frac{5}{18} \times 40 </mrow>
                    <mrow> =\amp \frac{200}{18} </mrow>
                    <mrow> =\amp \frac{100}{9}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, John will require <m>11\frac{1}{9}</m> hours, to complete the remaining work.
            </p>
        </solution>
