    <title>Rates of work</title>
    <p>
        The rate of work is a measure of how quickly work is done or how much work is completed in a given amount of time.
         It is often expressed as the amount of work done per unit of time, such as hours, days, or weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        When dealing with rates of work, the key is to find out how much work a person/thing can do in one hour, one day, or any other time unit.

        <statement>
            <p>
                A group of workers can complete a task in <m>8</m> hours. If they work at the same rate, how long will it take them to complete the same task if they double their effort?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <!-- <p>
                <m>\textbf{Rate of work}</m> is the amount of work done per unit of time, often expressed as work divided by time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, the rate of work can be calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Rate of work} = \frac{\text{Total work done}}{\text{Time taken}}</m>
            </p> -->
            <p>
                If the group of workers can complete a task in <m>8</m> hours, doubling their effort means they will work twice as fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the time taken to complete the same task when they double their effort will be half of <m>8</m> hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Time taken} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, it will take them <m>4</m> hours to complete the same task if they double their effort.

        <statement>
            <p>
                A factory produces <m>100</m> units of a product in <m>5</m> hours. If the factory increases its production rate by <m>20%</m>, how many units will it produce in <m>5</m> hours?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The factory's current production rate is <m>100</m> units in <m>5</m> hours, which means it produces <m>20</m> units per hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the factory increases its production rate by <m>20%</m>, the new production rate will be:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{New production rate} = 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ units per hour}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, to find out how many units the factory will produce in <m>5</m> hours at the new production rate:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Units produced in 5 hours} = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ units}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the factory will produce <m>120</m> units in <m>5</m> hours after increasing its production rate by <m>20%</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Mary, John and Essy did a piece of work in <m>45</m> hours, <m>40</m> hours and <m>30</m> hours respectively.
                How long can John take to complete the work when he starts after Mary and Essy have worked for <m>13</m> hours each?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, we need to find out the amount of work done by Mary, John, and Essy in one hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work done by each person in one hour is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Mary's rate} = \frac{1}{45} \text{ of the work per hour}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{John's rate} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ of the work per hour}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Essy's rate} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ of the work per hour}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the amount of work Mary and Essy will do in <m>1</m> hour is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\frac{1}{45} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{2}{90} + \frac{3}{90} = \frac{5}{90} </m>
            </p>
            <p>
               <m>= \frac{1}{18} \text{ of the work per hour}</m> 
            </p>
            <p>
                For <m>13</m> hours, Mary and Essy will have done:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>13 \times \frac{1}{18} = \frac{13}{18} \text{ of the work}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                The remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for <m>13</m> hours is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m> 1 - \frac{13}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ of the work}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, to find out how long it will take John to complete the remaining work, we can use his rate of work:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\text{Time taken by John} = \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{John's rate}} = \frac{\frac{5}{18}}{\frac{1}{40}} = \frac{5}{18} \times 40  </m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>= \frac{200}{18} = \frac{100}{9}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, John will take approximately <m>11\frac{1}{9}</m> hours to complete the remaining work after Mary and Essy have worked for <m>13</m> hours each.
            </p>
        </solution>
