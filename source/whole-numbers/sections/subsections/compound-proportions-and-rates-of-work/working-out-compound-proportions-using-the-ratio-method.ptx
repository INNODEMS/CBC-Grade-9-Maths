    <title>Working out compound proportions using the ratio method</title>
    <p>
        Two quantities in compound proportion increases or decreases in the same ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
        To work out compound proportions using the ratio method, you can follow these steps:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Identify the two ratios you want to compare or relate.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Set up a proportion by equating the two ratios.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Solve for the unknown variable, if applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Check your solution by substituting back into the original ratios to ensure they are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have the ratios <m>3:4</m> and <m>6:8</m>, you can set up the proportion as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{8}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-multiplying gives you <m>3 \times 8 = 4 \times 6</m>, which simplifies to <m>24</m>. This confirms that the two ratios are equivalent.

                2. Record the measurements of the lengths and widths of triangle A and triangle B.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Calculate the ratio of the lengths and widths of triangle A to triangle B.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: length ratio = <m>\frac{\text{Length of B}}{\text{Length of A}}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Compare the two ratios. What do you notice about the relationship between the two triangles?

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A class has <m>8</m> girls and <m>6</m> boys. More students are admitted to the class such that the ratio of girls to boys remain th same.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new number of boys in the class is now <m>12</m>. Determine the new number of girls in the class using the ratio method.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The initial ratio of girls to boys is <m>8:6</m>, which simplifies to <m>4:3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let the number of girls after admission be <m>y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore,  setting up the proportion we have:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>y: 12 = 4:3</m>
            </p>
            <p>
               Hence,  <m>\frac{y}{12} = \frac{4}{3}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, cross-multiplying to solve for <m>y</m>: 
            </p>
            <p>
                 <m>3y = 4 \times 12</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>3y = 48</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>y = \frac{48}{3} = 16</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                 So, the new number of girls in the class is <m>16</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
               Kipngetich measured the heights of a mango tree and a person standing under the tree in a photo.
                Their heights in the photo were <m>10 </m>cm and <m>5</m> cm respectively. 
               He observed that the ratio of their actual heights is the same as that in the photo.
                Determine the actual height of the mango tree if the actual height of the person is <m>2.5</m> meters. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The ratio of the heights in the photo is <m>10:5</m>, which simplifies to <m>2:1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let the actual height of the mango tree be <m>h</m> meters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given:
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual height of the person is <m>2.5</m> meters.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the actual height ratio is: <m>h:2.5 = 2:1</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Setting up the proportion, we have:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\frac{h}{2.5} = \frac{2}{1}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cross-multiplying gives us:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>h = 2 \times 2.5</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>h = 5</m> meters.
            </p>
            <p>
                
            </p>
