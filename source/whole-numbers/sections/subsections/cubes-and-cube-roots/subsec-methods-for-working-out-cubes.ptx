        <p>
           Use of a calculator is the easiest and fastest way to calculate cubes of numbers
        </p>
        
        <p>
            While finding the cubes of number, always pay attention to the sign
            preceeding the number.

            Subtraction is deducting one number from the other. For instance, if Olivia had
            10 sweets then she ate 3, she remains with 7.
        </p>
        <p>
            In subtraction a negative and a negative, gives a negative result. 
            While a positive and a negative gives a negative result.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example <m>-2-10=-12</m> and <m>3-9=-6</m>

            Division means sharing among a given quantity.
            A basic example is how a mother decides to share oranges she 
            buys among her children, so that each one gets the same number
            of oranges.
