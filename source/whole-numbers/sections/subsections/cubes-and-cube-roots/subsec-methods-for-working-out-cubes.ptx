    <introduction>
        <p>
         There are different ways of working out cubes of numbers. 
         They include use of a calculator or a mathematical table.

         <title>Finding cubes with a calculator</title>
        <p>
            Use of a calculator is the easiest and fastest way to calculate cubes of numbers. 
            A cube is simply <m>x^3</m>. Where <m>x</m> is any numerical value
        </p>
        <p>
            While finding the cubes of a number, always pay attention to the sign
            preceeding the number.
