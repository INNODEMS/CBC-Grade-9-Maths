    <title>Laws of indices</title>
    <p>
        The laws of indices, also known as the laws of exponents, are fundamental rules that govern the manipulation of expressions involving powers or indices.
         These laws are essential for simplifying calculations and solving equations involving exponential terms. Here are the key laws of indices:

    <p>
        1. **Product of Powers**: When multiplying two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents:
        <m>a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. **Quotient of Powers**: When dividing two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents:
        <m>\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}</m>, where <m>a \neq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. **Power of a Power**: When raising an expression with an exponent to another exponent, you multiply the exponents:
        <m>(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. **Power of a Product**: When raising a product to an exponent, you raise each factor to the exponent:
        <m>(ab)^n = a^n \cdot b^n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. **Power of a Quotient**: When raising a quotient to an exponent, you raise both the numerator and denominator to the exponent:
        <m>\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}</m>, where <m>b \neq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. **Zero Exponent**: Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is equal to one:
        <m>a^0 = 1</m>, where <m>a \neq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. **Negative Exponent**: A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent:
        <m>a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}</m>, where <m>a \neq 0</m>.
    </p>
