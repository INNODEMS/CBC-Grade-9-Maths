    <title>Powers of 10 and common logarithms</title>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
    
         <m>\bullet</m> <m> \textbf{Powers of 10 }</m> are numbers that represent a base of <m>10</m> raised to an exponent.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The common logarithm, denoted as <m>\log_{10}</m>, is the logarithm to the base <m>10</m>.
         It is used to express numbers in terms of powers of <m>10</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The common logarithm of a number <m>x</m> is defined as the exponent to which the base <m>10</m> must be raised to obtain <m>x</m>. 
        In mathematical terms, if <m>y = \log_{10}(x)</m>, then <m>10^y = x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if <m>x = 1000</m>, then <m>\log_{10}(1000) = 3</m> because <m>10^3 = 1000</m>.
        This means that <m>1000</m> can be expressed as <m>10^3</m>, which is a power of <m>10</m>.
