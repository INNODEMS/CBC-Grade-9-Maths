    <title>Fractional indices</title>
    <p>
        Fractional indices, also known as rational indices, are used to represent roots of numbers in index form. 
        A fractional index indicates that the base is raised to a power and then the root is taken.

        For example, if we have a base <m>a</m> and a fractional index <m>\frac{m}{n}</m>, it can be expressed as:
        <m>a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}</m>.
        This means that we first raise <m>a</m> to the power of <m>m</m> and then take the <m>n</m>-th root of the result.
