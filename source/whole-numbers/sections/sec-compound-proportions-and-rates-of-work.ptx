    <title>Compound proportions and Rates of work</title>
    <introduction>
        
        <p>
            Any <m>4</m> numbers  <m>a, b, c</m> and <m>d</m> are said to be proportional if their ratios are equal, that is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}</me>
        
            <m>\quad\quad</m>or
        
            <me>\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{d} </me>
        </p>
         <p>
            For example, consider the numbers <m>4, 10, 20</m> and <m>50</m>. Since <m>4:10 = 2:5</m> and <m>20:50 = 2:5</m>, the two ratios are equal <m>(4:10 = 20:50)</m>. 
            Therefore, these four numbers are proportional.
        </p>

            Proportions appear everywhere in our daily life. For instance, when preparing a meal for many people you would need to increase the amount of ingredients. 
            To keep the same taste, you must maintain the proportions between them. 
            Similarly, proportions help us compare relationships in areas such as speed, scale drawings, and work problems.

        <p>
            <m>\textbf{Rate of work}</m> is the amount of work done per unit of time, often expressed as work divided by time
