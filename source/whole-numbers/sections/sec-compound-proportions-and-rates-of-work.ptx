        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the numbers <m>4, 10, 20</m> and <m>50</m>. <m>4:10 = 2:5</m> and <m>20:50 = 2:5 </m>. The two ratios are equal  <m>(4:10 = 20:50)</m>. Therefore, these <m>4</m> numbers are said to be proportional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, any <m>4</m> numbers  <m>a, b, c</m> and <m>d</m> are said to be proportional if: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            or
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{d} </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\textbf{Why is proportions important in real life}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Proportions are everywhere in our daily life, and are very useful. For example, when preparing a meal for many people you would need to increase the amount of ingredients. 
            To do this without altering the taste, you would have to maintain the proportions between various ingredients. They are also important for determining relationships. 
            If you were at a shop and told an item has a discount of sh <m>50</m> but you do not know its original price, this would not be useful information. 
            However, if you are instead told it is <m>15%</m> off, it has a larger effect as you now know the proportion of the new price versus the old price.
