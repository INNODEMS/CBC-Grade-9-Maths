            Indices and logarithms are mathematical concepts that deal with powers and roots of numbers. They are used to simplify calculations involving large numbers and to express relationships between quantities in a more manageable form.

            Indices, also known as exponents, represent the number of times a base is multiplied by itself.
            For example, in the expression <m>a^n</m>, <m>a</m> is the base and <m>n</m> is the exponent or index.
            This means that <m>a</m> is multiplied by itself <m>n</m> times.

            Logarithms, on the other hand, are the inverse of exponentiation. 
            The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which a given base must be raised to obtain that number.
            For example, if <m>b^x = y</m>, then <m>x = \log_b(y)</m>, where <m>b</m> is the base and <m>y</m> is the number.
