                In our day-to-day life, we often encounter shapes and objects whether it’s
            the surface of a table, the wall of a house, the face of a pyramid, or even a football. 
            
            This topic will help you explore how to calculate area and surface area of various 2D and 3D 
            shapes in real and practical situations.
