    <title>Mass, Volume, Weight and Density</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In our daily life we see and use many objects. Each object takes up space, which we call volume.  
            Objects also have mass, which is the amount of matter in them. Because of the pull of gravity, mass gives us weight.  
            When we compare the mass of an object to the space it takes, we find its density.  
            In this substrand, we will learn more about mass, volume, weight, and density.
