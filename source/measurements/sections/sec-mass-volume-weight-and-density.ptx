        <introduction>
            <p>
            In this section, learners will explore the concepts of mass, volume, weight, and density.
            By the end of this substrand, learners should be able to:

        <ol>
            <li xml:id="objective-understand-concepts">
                Understand the concepts of mass, volume, weight, and density.
            </li>
            <li xml:id="objective-unit-conversion-mass-volume-weight-density">
                Convert between different units of mass and volume.
            </li>
            <li xml:id="objective-explain-relationships-mass-weight">
                Explain the relationship between mass and weight and how it is affected by gravitational field strength.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <conclusion>
            <p>
             These objectives aim to build both conceptual understanding and practical problem-solving skills in working with mass, volume, weight, and density.
             You are now ready to begin!
