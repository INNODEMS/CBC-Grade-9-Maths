                        Identify a measured path around the school where a "journey" can take place, such as walking 100 meters from the gate to a classroom block, and another 50 meters from the classroom block to the school canteen.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        One group member acts as the "traveler" and walks the first 100 meters while another times the walk using a stopwatch. Record the time taken for this segment.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        After finishing the first part of the journey, the "traveler" takes a timed rest break of 5 minutes to simulate a lunch break. Record this break time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The traveler then walks the second 50-meter stretch. Record the time taken for this second part of the walk.

                    <p>
                        Now calculate the total distance walked and the total time taken (including the 5-minute break).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the formula <m>\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}</m> to compute the average speed in meters per second.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Discuss in your group: How does the break time affect the average speed? What would the speed be without including the break time?

    <remark>
        <p>
            Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. 
            It gives us an overall idea of how fast an object is moving, regardless of any variations in speed during the journey.

            Consider a scenario where a car travels <m>100</m> km in <m>1</m> hour, then <m>50</m> km in <m>30</m> minutes. 
            What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?
        </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A cyclist cycles <m>30</m> km in <m>2</m> hours and then <m>20</m> km in <m>1</m> hour. 
                What is the average speed of the cyclist for the entire trip?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Total distance = <m>30</m> km + <m>20</m> km = <m>50</m> km
            </p>
            <p>
                Total time = <m>2</m> hours + <m>1</m> hour = <m>3</m> hours
            </p>
            <p>
                Average speed = <m>\frac{50 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ hours}} \approx 16.67 \text{ km/h}</m>
            </p>
        </solution>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A car travels <m>150</m> km in <m>2</m> hours, then takes a <m>30</m>-minute break, and 
                later travels another <m>100</m> km in <m>1.5</m> hours. 
                What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Total distance = <m>150</m> km + <m>100</m> km = <m>250</m> km
            </p>
            <p>
                Total time = <m>2</m> hours + <m>0.5</m> hour (break) + <m>1.5</m> hours = <m>4</m> hours
            </p>
            <p>
                Average speed = <m>\frac{250 \text{ km}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 62.5 \text{ km/h}</m>
