            <li>
                <p>
                    Identify pairs of cities that lie on the same longitude. Record their names and longitudes.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use the rule that places on the same longitude experience the same local time to explain which cities share the same time of day.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Identify pairs of cities that are equidistant from the Prime Meridian but on opposite sides (e.g., 53°E and 53°W). 
                    Discuss whether they experience the same time of day and explain your reasoning.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Discuss: If it is 10:00 AM at City B, what is the time at City E? Use the 4 minutes per degree rule to support your answer.
                </p>

                    Present your findings to the class and explain how Earth's rotation affects the relationship between longitude and time.

    <remark>
        <p>
            The earth rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation every 24 hours. 
            This rotation causes the cycle of day and night.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earth rotates from <alert>west</alert> to <alert>east</alert>, which means that as the earth rotates, 
            different parts of the world experience daylight and darkness at different times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Places that are located at the same longitude will experience the same time of day,
            while places that are located at different longitudes will experience different times of day.
        </p>

                In <xref ref="fig-relating-longitudes-to-time"/> below, cities A, B, C, D, E, and F are located at various longitudes.  
                Determine which of these cities experience the same time of day.

            <p>
                Cities B and C lie on the same longitude (<m>22^\circ</m> E), which means they experience the same local time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cities E and F are at <m>53^\circ</m> W, and City D is at <m>53^\circ</m> E. 
                Since they are equally distant from the Prime Meridian, they experience the same local time.
