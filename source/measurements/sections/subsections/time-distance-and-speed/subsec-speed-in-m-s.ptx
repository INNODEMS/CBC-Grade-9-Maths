                        Go outside to the school field. Measure and mark a straight distance of 40 meters using a tape measure or meter wheel.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Choose one student from your group to run the <m>40</m>-meter distance while another student uses a stopwatch to time how long it takes in seconds.

                    <p>
                        Record the distance (in meters) and the time taken (in seconds) in your notebook.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the formula <m>Speed = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}</m> to calculate the running speed in meters per second (m/s).

                        Repeat the activity with different group members and compare your results. Discuss why the speeds may differ among individuals.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Onyango walked <m>3</m> km from Lubao to Kakamega town in <m>90</m> minutes.
                Determine his speed in metres per second (m/s).

            <p>
                Convert the distance from kilometres to metres:

            <p>
                <m>3</m> km = (<m>3</m> <m>\times</m> <m>1000</m>) m = <m>3000</m> m
            </p>
            <p>
                Convert the time from minutes to seconds:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>90</m> minutes = (<m>90</m> <m>\times</m> <m>60</m>) s = <m>5400</m> s
            </p>
            <p>
                Speed <m>= \frac{3000 \text{ m}}{5400 \text{ s}} = \frac{5}{9} \text{ m/s}</m>
            </p>

                A car travels <m>150</m> m in <m>10</m> seconds. What is its speed in metres per second (m/s)?
