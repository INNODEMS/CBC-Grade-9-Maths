    <remark>
        <p>
            The earth rotates on its axis from <em>west</em> to <em>east</em>, 
            which means that places to the east of a given location will experience sunrise earlier than those to the west. 
            This results in different local times for places along different longitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earth takes <m>24</m> hours to complete one full rotation covering <m>360</m> degrees of longitude,
            which means that each <term>hour</term> corresponds to <m>15</m> degrees of longitude (360 degrees <m>\div</m> <m>24</m> hours <m>=</m> <m>15</m> degrees/hour).
            Therefore, for every <m>15</m> degrees of longitude difference between two places, there is a one-hour difference in local time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the earth covers <m>1^\circ</m> of longitude in <m>4</m> minutes. We gain time as we move eastward and lose time as we move westward.
        </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Town A is situated at <m>40^\circ</m> E longitude. What will be the local time in Town A when it is <m>12:00</m> noon at the Prime Meridian?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Town A is located <m>40^\circ</m> east of the Prime Meridian. To find the time difference, we use the fact that the Earth rotates through <m>1^\circ</m> of longitude every <m>4</m> minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the time difference between Town A and the Prime Meridian is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>40^\circ \times 4 = 160</m> minutes
            </p>
            <p>
                Converting <m>160</m> minutes into hours and minutes:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>160 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Town A is east of the Prime Meridian, its local time is ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, when it is <m>12:00</m> noon at the Prime Meridian, the local time in Town A is <m>2:40</m> PM.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                If it is 10:00 am at <m>50^\circ</m> E, what time is it at <m>30^\circ</m> W?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The total difference in longitude between <m>50^\circ</m> E and <m>30^\circ</m> W is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>50 + 30 = 80</m> degrees
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the Earth rotates <m>1^\circ</m> every <m>4</m> minutes, the time difference is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>80 \times 4 = 320</m> minutes
            </p>
            <p>
                Converting <m>320</m> minutes into hours and minutes:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>320 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours and } 20 \text{ minutes}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>50^\circ</m> E is east of <m>30^\circ</m> W, we need to subtract the time difference from the time at <m>50^\circ</m> E.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the time at <m>30^\circ</m> W is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>10:00 \text{ am} - 5 \text{ hours and } 20 \text{ minutes} = 4:40 \text{ am}</m>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                If it is 3:00 pm at <m>90^\circ</m> W, what time is it at <m>60^\circ</m> E?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The total difference in longitude between <m>90^\circ</m> W and <m>60^\circ</m> E is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>90 + 60 = 150</m> degrees
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the Earth rotates <m>1^\circ</m> every <m>4</m> minutes, the time difference is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>150 \times 4 = 600</m> minutes
            </p>
            <p>
                Converting <m>600</m> minutes into hours and minutes:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>600 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ hours}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>90^\circ</m> W is west of <m>60^\circ</m> E, we need to add the time difference to the time at <m>90^\circ</m> W.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the time at <m>60^\circ</m> E is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>3:00 \text{ pm} + 10 \text{ hours} = 1:00 \text{ am}</m>
            </p>
