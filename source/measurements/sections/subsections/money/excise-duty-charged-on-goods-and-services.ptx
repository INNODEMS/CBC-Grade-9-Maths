  <title>Understanding Excise Duty</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Excise duty is a tax charged by the government on specific goods produced or sold in a country, 
      especially items like fuel, alcohol, cigarettes, and sugary drinks. It is used to reduce consumption 
      of harmful products and to raise government revenue.

      In this activity, you'll choose a product, calculate the excise duty, and explore how this tax affects pricing.

<example>
  <title>Example: Excise Duty on Cigarettes</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A packet of cigarettes costs Ksh 500. The excise duty is 30%.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Step 1: Calculate the excise duty:
      <abbr/>
      (30 Ã· 100) Ã— 500 = Ksh 150
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2: Add the excise duty to the original price:
      <abbr/>
      Total Price = 500 + 150 = Ksh 650
    </p>
    <p>
      The customer will pay <m>\textbf{Ksh 650}</m> for one packet of cigarettes after excise duty is added.
    </p>
  </solution>

  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Step 1: Calculate the excise duty:

    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2: Add the duty to the original price:  
      Total Price = 150 + 15 = Ksh 165
    </p>
    <p>
       In Kenya, the customer pays <m>\textbf{Ksh 165}</m> after excise duty on a 1-litre bottle of soda.
