  <title>Understanding Import Duty</title>
  
  <statement>
    <p>
      When goods are brought into a country from another country, this is called <em>importing</em>. 
      The government may charge an <m>\textbf{import duty}</m>â€”a type of taxâ€”to help protect local businesses and raise revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this activity, you will work in groups to decide which imported product you would choose and calculate the import duty and total cost.
    </p>
  <p>
    Imagine you are a business owner in Kenya who wants to import products from other countries. 
    The government charges import duty on certain goods, which affects how much you pay for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work in pairs or groups. Each group will pick one product from the list below and follow the steps provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some products you can choose from:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>School Buses â€“ Value: Ksh 2,000,000 â€“ Import duty: 25%

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Laptops â€“ Value: Ksh 120,000 â€“ Import duty: 10%

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Clothing â€“ Value: Ksh 80,000 â€“ Import duty: 15%

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Machinery â€“ Value: Ksh 300,000 â€“ Import duty: 20%

        </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
  <p>
    ðŸ”¹ Choose one product your group would import and explain why you chose it.
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ”¹ Calculate the import duty using the formula:  
    <m>\textbf{Import Duty = (Rate Ã· 100) Ã— Value of the product}</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ”¹ Add the import duty to the original product value to find the total cost after importing.
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ”¹ If the import duty was reduced by 5%, how would this affect your total cost? Would it change your choice? Discuss.
  </p>

  <title>Example: Calculating Import Duty on Machinery</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A business is importing machinery worth Ksh 300,000. The import duty is 20%.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Step 1: Calculate the import duty:
      <abbr/>
      Import Duty = (20 Ã· 100) Ã— 300,000 = Ksh 60,000
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 2: Add the duty to the original price:
      <abbr/>
      Total Cost = 300,000 + 60,000 = Ksh 360,000
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the total cost after importing is <m>\textbf{Ksh 360,000}</m>.
    </p>

  <title>Example: Import and Excise Duty Calculation</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Alex imported a generator with a customs value of Ksh 60,000. He was charged an import duty of 12% and an excise duty of 15%.
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>How much did he pay as import duty?</p></li>
      <li><p>Calculate the excise value for the generator.</p></li>
      <li><p>Determine the excise duty paid.</p></li>
      <li><p>How much money did Alex pay in total for the generator?</p></li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>Calculate the import duty:</p>
    <p>
      <md><mrow>\text{Import Duty} = 12\% \text{ of } 60,000 = \frac{12}{100} \times 60000 \amp = 7,200</mrow></md>
    </p>

    <p>Excise value = Customs value + Import duty:</p>
    <p>
      <md><mrow>60000 + 7200 \amp = 67,200</mrow></md>
    </p>

    <p>Calculate the excise duty:</p>
    <p>
      <md><mrow>15\% \text{ of } 67200 = \frac{15}{100} \times 67200 \amp = 10,080</mrow></md>
    </p>

    <p>Total amount paid = Customs value + Import duty + Excise duty:</p>
    <p>
      <md><mrow>60000 + 7200 + 10080 \amp = 77,280</mrow></md>
    </p>

    <p>
       <m>\textbf{Alex paid a total of Ksh 77,280 for the generator.}</m>
    </p>
  </solution>
