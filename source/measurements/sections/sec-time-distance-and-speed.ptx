    <title>Time, Distance and Speed</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Every school day, you wake up in the morning and either walk or ride a bicycle from home to school.  
            On the way, you cover a certain distance. It becomes interesting to know the time you reached
            school and how long it took you to get there.  
            If we know both the time and the distance, we can easily find out the speed of your journey.  
            In this substrand, we will learn more about time, distance, and speed.
