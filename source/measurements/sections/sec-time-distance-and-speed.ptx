        <introduction>
            <p>
            In this section, learners will explore the relationship between time, distance, and speed.
            By the end of this substrand, learners should be able to:

        </introduction>
        <ol>
            <li xml:id="objective-understand-formula">
                Understand and apply the formula: <q>Speed = Distance รท Time</q>.
            </li>
            <li xml:id="objective-unit-conversion">
                Convert between units of time (minutes to hours) and distance (meters to kilometers).
            </li>
            <li xml:id="objective-solve-problems">
                 Solve real-world word problems involving speed, distance, and time.
            </li>
            <li xml:id="objective-interpret-results">
                Interpret the results of speed calculations in practical contexts (e.g., travel, races, delivery).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <conclusion>
            <p>
             These objectives aim to build both conceptual understanding and practical problem-solving skills in calculating speed, time, and distance.
             You are now ready to begin!
