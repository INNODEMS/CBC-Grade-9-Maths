  <title>Solving Linear Inequalities in One and Two Unknowns</title>

    <p>
      In the previous section, we learned how to interpret inequalities from real-life contexts. Now, we will focus on solving linear inequalities and representing their solutions — both in one and two variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving a linear inequality is similar to solving an equation, except the solution is often a range of values. These values can be shown on a number line (for one variable) or on a coordinate plane (for two variables).
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses direction.

            In your group, solve each of the following inequalities and represent the solution on a number line:
            <ol marker="a)">
              <li><m>x + 4 &lt; 9</m></li>
              <li><m>2x \ge 12</m></li>
              <li><m>-3x \gt 6</m></li>
              <li><m>\frac{x - 2}{3} \le 5</m></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            For each inequality, discuss with your partner how the solution set is different from that of an equation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Share your number line diagrams with another group and compare your ranges.

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving linear inequalities involves similar steps to solving equations, but always remember to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. For two-variable inequalities, graph the boundary and shade the region of solutions.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve and represent the solution to the inequality: <m>3x - 5 \le 10</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>3x - 5 \le 10</mrow>
            <mrow>3x \le 15</mrow>
            <mrow>x \le 5</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution is all values of <m>x</m> less than or equal to 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a number line, this is shown as a solid dot at 5 and shading to the left.
        </p>
      </solution>

      <p><term>Instructions:</term></p>
      <p>
        <ol marker="a)">
          <li>Plot the boundary line for the inequality <m>y \lt 2x + 3</m>. Use a dashed line since the inequality does not include equality.</li>
          <li>Pick a test point like <m>(0,0)</m> to determine which side of the line to shade.</li>
          <li>Shade the correct region that represents all solutions to the inequality.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process for <m>y \ge -x + 1</m>, this time using a solid line.</li>
          <li>Discuss the meaning of overlapping shaded regions if both inequalities were given together.</li>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve and graph the inequality: <m>y \le 2x + 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Step 1: Draw the line <m>y = 2x + 1</m>. Since the inequality is <m>\le</m>, draw a solid line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 2: Choose a test point like <m>(0,0)</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>0 \le 2(0) + 1 → 0 \le 1</m>, which is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 3: Shade the region below the line, since it represents all values of <m>y</m> less than or equal to <m>2x + 1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
