  <title>Interpreting Linear Inequalities in One and Two Unknowns</title>

    <p>
      In daily life, we often work with conditions or limits, but sometimes we work with exact values like "You must be at least <m>18</m> years old to vote" or "The bag should not weigh more than <m>10</m> kg".
    </p>
    <p>
      A <m>\textbf{linear inequality}</m> is a mathematical sentence that uses inequality symbols instead of the equals sign. These include:
      <ul>
        <li><m>\lt</m> (less than)</li>
        <li><m>\le</m> (less than or equal to)</li>
        <li><m>\gt</m> (greater than)</li>
        <li><m>\ge</m> (greater than or equal to)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Linear inequalities can have one unknown (e.g., <m>x \ge 10</m>) or two unknowns (e.g., <m>y \lt 2x + 5</m>), and they represent a range of possible values that satisfy the condition.

        Discuss the following real-life situations and write an appropriate linear inequality for each.

            <li>A student must score at least 50 marks to pass an exam. Let <m>x</m> be the marks scored.</li>
            <li>A matatu cannot carry more than 14 passengers. Let <m>p</m> be the number of passengers.</li>
            <li>A phone costs more than Ksh <m>5,000</m>. Let <m>c</m> be the cost.</li>
            <li>The total luggage weight must be less than or equal to <m>25</m> kg. Let <m>w</m> be the weight.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        After writing the inequalities, answer the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>Identify whether each inequality has one or two unknowns.</li>
          <li>Explain your interpretation to another group and listen to theirs.</li>

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      Linear inequalities describe limitations or conditions in real-life situations. They allow us to work with ranges of possible values rather than just one answer.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A parent gives a student Ksh <m>500</m> for lunch for the week. If lunch costs <m>x</m> shillings per day and they have <m>5</m> school going days, write an inequality to represent how much can be spent per day.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The total cost for <m>5</m> days is <m>5x</m>. The student cannot spend more than Ksh <m>500</m>, so:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>5x \le 500</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving the inequality:
        </p>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>5x \le 500</mrow>
            <mrow>x \le 100</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means the student can spend at most Ksh <m>100</m> each day.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
