  <title>Determining the Gradient from Two Known Points</title>

    <p>
      In many situations, we are given two points on a straight path and want to determine how steep that path is. These two points may represent physical locations, price changes, distances over time, or any relationship that forms a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the gradient between any two points on a straight line, we compare how much the value changes vertically (rise) with how much it changes horizontally (run).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradients are useful in describing real situations such as speed, price change, or slope of land.

    <p><term>Key Takeaway:</term></p>
    <p>
      The gradient between two points shows how steep the line is. It is found by dividing the change in <m>y</m> values (rise) by the change in <m>x</m> values (run).
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the gradient of the line passing through the points <m>(1, 4)</m> and <m>(5, 10)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><m>x_1 = 1, \quad y_1 = 4</m></li>
            <li><m>x_2 = 5, \quad y_2 = 10</m></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Apply the gradient formula:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m> m = \frac{10 - 4}{5 - 1} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 </m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the gradient of the line is <m>1.5</m>. This means for every <m>1</m> unit moved to the right, the line goes up by <m>1.5</m> units.
        </p>
      </solution>
