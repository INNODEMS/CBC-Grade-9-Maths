  <title>Determining the Gradient from Two Known Points</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In many situations, we are given two points on a straight path and want to determine how steep that path is. These two points may represent physical locations, price changes, distances over time, or any relationship that forms a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the gradient between any two points on a straight line, we compare how much the value changes vertically (rise) with how much it changes horizontally (run).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the two points are given as <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, then the gradient <m>m</m> is calculated using:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m> m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} </m>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called the gradient formula. It gives a numerical value to the steepness between the two points.

    <title>Example: Calculating the Gradient</title>
    <p>
      Find the gradient of the line passing through the points <m>(1, 4)</m> and <m>(5, 10)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>x_1 = 1, \quad y_1 = 4</m></li>
        <li><m>x_2 = 5, \quad y_2 = 10</m></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Apply the gradient formula:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m> m = \frac{10 - 4}{5 - 1} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 </m>
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the gradient of the line is <m>1.5</m>. This means for every 1 unit moved to the right, the line goes up by 1.5 units.
    </p>

  <conclusion>
    <p><m>\textbf{Key Takeaway:}</m></p>
    <p>
      The gradient between two points shows how steep the line is. It is found by dividing the change in <m>y</m> values (rise) by the change in <m>x</m> values (run).
    </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>Use the gradient formula to solve the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the gradient of the line that passes through the points <m>(2, 5)</m> and <m>(6, 13)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Two points on a road are given as <m>A(0, 0)</m> and <m>B(8, 2)</m>. What is the gradient of the slope from A to B?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A shop's profit changed from Ksh <m>1,200</m> in week 1 to Ksh <m>2,400</m> in week 4. Find the average rate of profit increase per week (gradient).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If the gradient between two points is zero, what does that tell you about the line? Give an example.
