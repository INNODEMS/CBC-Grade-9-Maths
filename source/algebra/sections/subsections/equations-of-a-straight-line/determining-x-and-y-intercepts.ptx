  <title>Determining the x- and y-Intercepts of a Line</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      When sketching or interpreting a linear graph, it is helpful to know where the line crosses the axes. These points are called the <m>\textbf{intercepts}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <m>\textbf{y-intercept}</m> is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This occurs when <m>x = 0</m>.</li>
        <li>The <m>\textbf{x-intercept}</m> is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. This occurs when <m>y = 0</m>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing both intercepts helps you to sketch a line quickly and accurately.

        <ol>
          <li>Choose the equation <m>y = 2x - 4</m>.</li>
          <li>To find the y-intercept, substitute <m>x = 0</m>.</li>
          <li>To find the x-intercept, substitute <m>y = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.</li>
          <li>Plot both points and draw the line on graph paper.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss with your partner: Why are these two points enough to draw the whole line?

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the x- and y-intercepts of the line given by the equation <m>y = -3x + 6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To find the y-intercept:</em> Set <m>x = 0</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>y = -3(0) + 6 = 6</m>, so the y-intercept is <m>(0, 6)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To find the x-intercept:</em> Set <m>y = 0</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>0 = -3x + 6</m> → <m>3x = 6</m> → <m>x = 2</m>, so the x-intercept is <m>(2, 0)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
  </worksheet>

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      <m>\textbf{Key Takeaway:}</m> The y-intercept is found by setting <m>x = 0</m>. The x-intercept is found by setting <m>y = 0</m>. These two points are enough to sketch a linear graph accurately.
