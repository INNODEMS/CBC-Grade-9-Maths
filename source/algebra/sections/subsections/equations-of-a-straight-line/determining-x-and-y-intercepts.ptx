  <title>Determining the x and y-intercepts of a Line</title>

    <p>
      When sketching or interpreting a linear graph, it is helpful to know where the line crosses the axes. These points are called the <m>\textbf{intercepts}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <m>\textbf{y-intercept}</m> is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This occurs when <m>x = 0</m>.</li>
        <li>The <m>\textbf{x-intercept}</m> is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. This occurs when <m>y = 0</m>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing both intercepts helps you to sketch a line quickly and accurately.

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      The y-intercept is found by setting <m>x = 0</m>. The x-intercept is found by setting <m>y = 0</m>. These two points are enough to sketch a linear graph accurately.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the x- and y-intercepts of the line given by the equation <m>y = -3x + 6</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the y-intercept, set <m>x = 0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>y = -3(0) + 6 = 6</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the y-intercept is <m>(0, 6)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the x-intercept, set <m>y = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>0 = -3x + 6</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rearranging gives:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>3x = 6</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Dividing both sides by 3:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>x = 2</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the x-intercept is <m>(2, 0)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the intercepts of the line are <m>(0, 6)</m> and <m>(2, 0)</m>.
        </p>
