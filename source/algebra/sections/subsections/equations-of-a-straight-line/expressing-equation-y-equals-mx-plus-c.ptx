  <title>Expressing the Equation in the Form <m>y = mx + c</m></title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      A straight line in a coordinate plane can be represented by an equation. One of the most useful and common forms is the <m>\textbf{slope-intercept form}</m>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>y = mx + c</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this equation:
      <ul>
        <li><m>m</m> is the gradient or slope of the line</li>
        <li><m>c</m> is the y-intercept — the point where the line crosses the y-axis</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this form helps us describe, sketch, and interpret linear relationships both in mathematical problems and real-life contexts.

        <ol>
          <li>Sketch a line with a gradient of <m>2</m> and a y-intercept of <m>3</m>. Label the line with its equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.</li>
          <li>Now sketch a second line with the same gradient but a different y-intercept, for example <m>-2</m>. Label it <m>y = 2x - 2</m>.</li>
          <li>Compare the two lines. What is similar? What is different?</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>Discuss: How does the value of <m>m</m> affect the steepness of a line?</li>
          <li>How does the value of <m>c</m> affect where the line crosses the y-axis?</li>
        </ul>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the equation <m>y = -3x + 6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the equation, we can identify:
          <ul>
            <li><m>m = -3</m> — the line slopes downwards</li>
            <li><m>c = 6</m> — the line crosses the y-axis at <m>(0, 6)</m></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that for every 1 unit increase in <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> decreases by 3 units.

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      <m>\textbf{Key Takeaway:}</m> In the equation <m>y = mx + c</m>, <m>m</m> tells us how steep the line is, and <m>c</m> tells us where the line crosses the y-axis. This form is very useful for sketching graphs and interpreting real-life situations mathematically.
