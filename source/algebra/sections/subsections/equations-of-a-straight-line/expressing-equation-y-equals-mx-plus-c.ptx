  <title>Expressing the Equation in the Form <m>y = mx + c</m></title>

    <p>
      A straight line in a coordinate plane can be represented by an equation. One of the most useful and common forms is the <m>\textbf{slope-intercept form}</m>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>y = mx + c</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this equation:
      <ul>
        <li><m>m</m> is the gradient or slope of the line</li>
        <li><m>c</m> is the y-intercept â€” the point where the line crosses the y-axis</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this form helps us describe, sketch, and interpret linear relationships both in mathematical problems and real-life contexts.

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the equation <m>y = mx + c</m>, <m>m</m> tells us how steep the line is, and <m>c</m> tells us where the line crosses the y-axis. This form is very useful for sketching graphs and interpreting real-life situations mathematically.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given the equation <m>y = 4x - 1</m>, identify the gradient and y-intercept.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          From the equation <m>y = 4x - 1</m>, we can see that:
          <ul>
            <li>The gradient <m>m = 4</m></li>
            <li>The y-intercept <m>c = -1</m></li>
          </ul>
          This means the line rises steeply (since the gradient is positive and greater than <m>1</m>) and crosses the y-axis at the point <m>(0, -1)</m>.
