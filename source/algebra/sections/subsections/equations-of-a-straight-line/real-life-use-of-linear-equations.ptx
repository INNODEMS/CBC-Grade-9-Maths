  <title>The Use of Equations of Straight Lines in Real Life</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Linear equations are not just for the classroom — they appear all around us in daily life. Any situation that involves a fixed starting value and a constant rate of change can be modelled using a straight-line equation of the form <m>y = mx + c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding these applications can help us make predictions, compare situations, and make informed decisions.

          <li>Interview a boda boda or taxi operator. Ask about how they charge their customers (e.g. base fare + per kilometre cost).</li>
          <li>Write down the relationship between distance travelled <m>x</m> and total cost <m>y</m>.</li>
          <li>Express this relationship as a linear equation in the form <m>y = mx + c</m>.</li>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A water tank is being filled at a constant rate. After 1 minute, it contains 20 litres. After 4 minutes, it contains 80 litres.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Step 1:</em> Identify the two points: <m>(1, 20)</m> and <m>(4, 80)</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Step 2:</em> Find the gradient (rate of change):
          <m>m = \frac{80 - 20}{4 - 1} = \frac{60}{3} = 20</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Step 3:</em> Use one point to form the equation:  
          <m>y - 20 = 20(x - 1)</m> → <m>y = 20x</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          This equation models the volume of water in the tank after <m>x</m> minutes.

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      <m>\textbf{Key Takeaway:}</m> Real-life situations involving steady increase or decrease can be modelled using linear equations. This makes it easier to predict, budget, or compare.
