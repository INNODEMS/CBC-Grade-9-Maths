  <title>The Use of Equations of Straight Lines in Real Life</title>

    <p>
      Linear equations are not just for the classroom â€” they appear all around us in daily life. Any situation that involves a fixed starting value and a constant rate of change can be modelled using a straight-line equation of the form <m>y = mx + c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding these applications can help us make predictions, compare situations, and make informed decisions.

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyday life situations involving steady increase or decrease can be modelled using linear equations. This makes it easier to predict, budget, or compare.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A water tank is being filled at a constant rate. After <m>1</m> minute, it contains <m>20</m> litres. After <m>4</m> minutes, it contains <m>80</m> litres.
        </p>
        <p>
          a) Find the equation that relates time <m>x</m> (in minutes) to the amount of water <m>y</m> (in litres).
        </p>
        <p>
          b) How much water will be in the tank after <m>10</m> minutes?
        </p>
        <p>
          c) How long will it take to fill the tank to <m>200</m> litres?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          a) First, find the gradient <m>m</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{80 - 20}{4 - 1} = \frac{60}{3} = 20</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, use the point <m>(1, 20)</m> to find <m>c</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>20 = 20(1) + c \Rightarrow c = 0</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the equation is <m>y = 20x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) To find the amount of water after <m>10</m> minutes, substitute <m>x = 10</m> into the equation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>y = 20(10) = 200</m> litres.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) To find how long it takes to fill the tank to <m>200</m> litres, set <m>y = 200</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>200 = 20x \Rightarrow x = \frac{200}{20} = 10</m> minutes.
        </p>
      </solution>
