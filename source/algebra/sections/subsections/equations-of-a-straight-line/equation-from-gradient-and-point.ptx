    <title>Determining the Equation of a Line from a Known Gradient and a Point</title>

        <p>
            In some cases, we may be told the <m>\textbf{gradient (m)}</m> of a line and given only one point that lies on it. Using this information, we can still find the full equation of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, we use the <m>\textbf{point-slope form}</m> of a linear equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m> y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> is the known point and <m>m</m> is the gradient. We can rearrange this into the familiar slope-intercept form:
            <m> y = mx + c </m>.
        </p>

            <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
        </p>
        <p>
            When given a gradient and one point on a line, you can use the point-slope form to find the full equation of the line. This method is efficient and avoids the need for a second point.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Write the equation of a line that has a gradient <m>m = 2</m> and passes through the point <m>(3, 4)</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We know the gradient <m>m = 2</m> and the point <m>(x_1, y_1) = (3, 4)</m>. Using the point-slope form:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Substituting the known values:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y - 4 = 2(x - 3) </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we will rearrange this into slope-intercept form:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y - 4 = 2x - 6 </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding 4 to both sides gives:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y = 2x - 2 </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the equation of the line is <m> y = 2x - 2 </m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
