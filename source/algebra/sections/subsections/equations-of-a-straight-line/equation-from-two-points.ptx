    <title>Determining the Equation of a Line Given Two Points</title>

        <p>
            Once you have learned how to calculate the gradient between two points, the next step is to use those two points to determine the unique equation of the line that connects them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section, we will introduce the idea that every straight line in the coordinate plane can be defined by its <m>\textbf{gradient}</m> and a point it passes through. This leads us to the <m>\textbf{point-slope form}</m> of a line, which can later be rearranged into the slope-intercept form: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <m> y = mx + c </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <m>m</m> is the gradient and <m>c</m> is the y-intercept.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we will combine your earlier work with a new process: determining the line's equation directly from two known points.

        <p>
            By determining the gradient between two points and substituting one of the points into the point-slope equation, we can derive the unique linear equation that passes through both points. This equation can then be rearranged into the form <m>y = mx + c</m>.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Determine the equation of a line that passes through the points <m>(2, 4)</m> and <m>(6, 12)</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the equation of the line, we will follow these steps:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Step 1: Calculate the Gradient</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the gradient formula:  
                    <m> m = \frac{12 - 4}{6 - 2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Step 2: Apply the Point-Slope Form</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choosing point <m>(2, 4)</m>, substitute into the point-slope form:  
                    <m> y - 4 = 2(x - 2) </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Step 3: Convert to Slope-Intercept Form</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expand and simplify:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y - 4 = 2x - 4 </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add <m>4</m> to both sides:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m> y = 2x </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.
                </p>
