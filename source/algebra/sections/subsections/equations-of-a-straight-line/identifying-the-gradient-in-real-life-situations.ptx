    <title>Identifying the Gradient in Real-Life Situations</title>
    
      <p>
        In our everyday environment we notice many surfaces that are slanted rather than perfectly flat. Think of the gentle incline of a ramp at your school, or the varying steepness of a hill on a familiar route. These everyday features are examples of what we call a <m>\textbf{gradient}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of focusing on the mathematics immediately, it is important to understand that the gradient describes how steep a path is—in other words, it tells us how quickly something rises or falls over a certain distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practical terms, this concept is useful in planning safe ramps, roads, or even understanding the effort required to climb a hill.

      <term>Key Takeaway:</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      The gradient gives a numerical value to the concept of steepness, allowing us to compare different slopes and understand their practical implications for safety, accessibility, and design.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose one ramp rises <m>1.2 m</m> over a horizontal distance of <m>4 m</m>. Express its steepness as a gradient.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the gradient, we use the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the rise is <m>1.2 m</m> and the run is <m>4 m</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\therefore \ \ \ \ \text{Gradient} = \frac{1.2}{4} = 0.3</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that for every <m>1 m</m> you move horizontally, the ramp rises by <m>0.3 m</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

              You are shown two walkways:

            <p>
                Walkway A: Rises by <m>1.5 \, \text{m}</m> over <m>6 \, \text{m}</m> horizontally
              </p>
              <p>
