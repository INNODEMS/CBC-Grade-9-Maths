    <title>Determining Compatibility of Matrices in Addition and Subtraction</title>
    <p>
        In real life, we often want to combine or compare data from different sourcesâ€”like adding up sales from two weeks, or comparing scores from two rounds of a game. To do this with matrices, the data must be organized in the same way. This means the matrices must have the same number of rows and columns (the same <m>order</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>Did you know?</m> You can only add or subtract matrices if they are the same size! This is just like adding two tables with the same number of rows and columns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's see how this works with a real-life example.

            The table below shows the number of books borrowed from a library by three students (Alice, Brian, and Carol) in two different months:

        <tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium">
            <row>
                <cell></cell>
                <cell>Month 1</cell>
                <cell>Month 2</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Alice</cell>
                <cell>4</cell>
                <cell>5</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Brian</cell>
                <cell>3</cell>
                <cell>6</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Carol</cell>
                <cell>5</cell>
                <cell>4</cell>
            </row>
        </tabular>
        <p>
            The next month, the same students borrowed the following number of books:
        </p>
        <tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium">
            <row>
                <cell></cell>
                <cell>Month 3</cell>
                <cell>Month 4</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Alice</cell>
                <cell>6</cell>
                <cell>3</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Brian</cell>
                <cell>2</cell>
                <cell>7</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
                <cell>Carol</cell>
                <cell>4</cell>
                <cell>5</cell>
            </row>
        </tabular>
        <p>Use the data in the tables to answer the following questions:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Write the Month 1 &amp; 2 data as a matrix <m>A</m> and the Month 3 &amp; 4 data as a matrix <m>B</m>.</li>
                <li>Can you add matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>Suppose you had a table for a different group of students with only two rows. Could you add this to matrix <m>A</m>?</li>
                <li>What does the sum <m>A + B</m> represent in this context?</li>
            </ol>

        You can only add or subtract matrices if they have the same order (same number of rows and columns). This allows us to combine or compare real-life data correctly, just like adding up tables with the same structure.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>The following matrices show the number of items sold by two shops over two days:</p>
            <p>
                <m>Shop\ 1: \quad A = \begin{bmatrix} 10 &amp; 12 \\ 8 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}</m>
                <m>Shop\ 2: \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 7 &amp; 5 \\ 6 &amp; 11 \end{bmatrix}</m>
            </p>
            <p>Can you add these matrices? If so, what does the result mean?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>Step 1: Check the order of both matrices.</p>
            <p>Matrix <m>A</m>: 2 rows, 2 columns. Matrix <m>B</m>: 2 rows, 2 columns. The orders are the same.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Add corresponding entries:</p>
            <p>
                <m>
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        10+7 &amp; 12+5 \\
                        8+6 &amp; 9+11
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        17 &amp; 17 \\
                        14 &amp; 20
                    \end{bmatrix}
                </m>
            </p>
            <p>Step 3: Interpret the result.</p>
            <p>The resulting matrix shows the total number of items sold by both shops on each day.</p>
        </solution>
