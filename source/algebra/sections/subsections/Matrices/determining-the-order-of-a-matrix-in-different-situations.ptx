    <title>Determining the Order of a Matrix in Different Situations</title>
    <p>
        The order of a matrix tells us how many rows and columns it has. This is written as rows × columns (for example, 2 × 3 means 2 rows and 3 columns). Knowing the order helps us describe, compare, and use tables and schedules correctly in real life.

        <m>Did you know?</m> The order of a matrix is like the size of a table—if you know the number of rows and columns, you know how much information it can hold!

        The order of a matrix helps us describe and use tables, schedules, and data sets correctly in real life. It tells us how much information the matrix can hold.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>The following matrix shows the number of books borrowed by three students (Alice, Brian, Carol) in four months:</p>
            <p>
                <m>
                    B = \begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 \\ 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 \\ 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}
                </m>
            </p>
            <p>What is the order of matrix <m>B</m>? What does the entry in the second row, third column represent?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>Step 1: Count the number of rows.</p>
            <p>There are 3 rows (each row represents a student).</p>
            <p>Step 2: Count the number of columns.</p>
            <p>There are 4 columns (each column represents a month).</p>
            <p>Step 3: Write the order as rows × columns.</p>
            <p>So, the order is 3 × 4.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Interpret the meaning.</p>
            <p>The entry in the second row, third column (5) means Brian borrowed 5 books in Month 3.</p>
        </solution>
