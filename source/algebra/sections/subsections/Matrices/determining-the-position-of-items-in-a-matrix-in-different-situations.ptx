    <title>Determining the Position of Items in a Matrix in Different Situations</title>
    <p>
        Every number or item in a matrix has a special place, just like a seat in a classroom or a product on a shelf. We use the row and column numbers to find the exact position of each item. This helps us quickly locate information in tables, scoreboards, or lists.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>Did you know?</m> The position of an item in a matrix is written as (row, column). For example, (2,3) means row 2, column 3.

            Imagine a 3×3 grid representing a simple map. Each cell can have a value: 0 (empty), 1 (tree), 2 (house), 3 (treasure). The map is represented by the following matrix:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>
            M = \begin{bmatrix}
            0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
            2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
            0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
            \end{bmatrix}
            </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is at position (2,2)? What does it represent?</li>
                <li>List all the positions where there is a house.</li>
                <li>If you start at (1,1) and move to (2,2), what do you find?</li>
                <li>Draw a simple sketch of the map using the matrix values as symbols.</li>
            </ol>

        The position (row, column) helps us locate and understand data in real-life matrices, maps, and grids. It makes finding information quick and fun!

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>Let's solve the map matrix puzzle:</p>
            <p>
                <m>
                M = \begin{bmatrix}
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
                0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
                \end{bmatrix}
                </m>
            </p>
            <p>1. <m>\textbf{What is at position (2,2)?}</m> The value is 3, which represents the treasure.</p>
            <p>2. <m>\textbf{List all the positions where there is a house (2):}</m></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(2,1)</li>
                    <li>(3,2)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>3. <m>\textbf{If you start at (1,1) and move to (2,2), what do you find?}</m> You find the treasure!</p>
            <p>4. <m>\textbf{Draw a simple sketch of the map:}</m> (Students draw a 3×3 grid and use symbols for each value: 0=empty, 1=tree, 2=house, 3=treasure.)</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>Step 1: Look up the value at (2,2):</p>
            <p>The value is 3 (<m>\textbf{treasure}</m>).</p>
            <p>Step 2: Find all positions with value 2 (house):</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(2,1)</li>
                    <li>(3,2)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Step 3: Moving from (1,1) to (2,2) leads to the treasure.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Students draw a grid and fill in the symbols for each value.</p>
        </solution>
