    <title>Identifying a Matrix in Different Situations</title>
        <p>
            A <m>\textbf{matrix}</m> is a way of organizing numbers or information in rows and columns—just like the tables you have seen in other topics such as measurement and data handling. 
            Matrices help us organize, compare, and analyze data efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Matrices are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing real-world data, such as sports scores, business sales, or scientific results. By turning tables into matrices, we can use mathematical methods to solve problems more easily.

            <p>The Greenfield School Cafeteria prepares meals for students in three school levels: <m>Lower Primary</m>, <m>Upper Primary</m>, and <m>Secondary</m>. Each week, they prepare two types of meals: <m>Vegetarian</m> and <m>Non-Vegetarian</m>. The number of meals prepared (in hundreds) for Week 1 and Week 2 is recorded in the tables below:</p>
