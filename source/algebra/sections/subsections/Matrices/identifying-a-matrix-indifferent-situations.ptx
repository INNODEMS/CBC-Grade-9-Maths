    <title>Identifying a Matrix in Different Situations</title>
        <p>
            A <m>\textbf{matrix}</m> is a way of organizing numbers or information in rows and columns—just like the tables you have seen in other topics such as measurement and data handling. 
            Matrices help us organize, compare, and analyze data efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\textbf{Did you know?}</m> The tables you used for currency exchange, frequency distributions, or measurement results are all examples of data that can be represented as matrices!
        </p>

        <p>
            Matrices are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing real-world data, such as sports scores, business sales, or scientific results. By turning tables into matrices, we can use mathematical methods to solve problems more easily.

                The Greenfield School Cafeteria prepares meals for students in three school levels: <m>\textbf{Lower Primary}</m>, 
                <m>\textbf{Upper Primary}</m>, and <m>\textbf{Secondary}</m>. Each week, they prepare two types of meals: <m>\textbf{Vegetarian}</m> and <m>\textbf{Non-Vegetarian}</m>. The number of meals prepared (in hundreds) for Week 1 and Week 2 is recorded in the tables below:

            A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers or data in rows and columns. It can represent real-life situations, such as meal preparation data, sports scores, or sales figures.

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>The following table shows the number of books read by three students (Alice, Brian, and Carol) in two terms:</p>
                <tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium">
                    <row>

                <p>Write this table as a matrix, where each row is a student and each column is a term. Then answer: Who read the most books in Term 2? How many books did Brian read in total?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Step 1: Write the matrix:</p>

                <p>
                    Columns: Term 1, Term 2.

                        <li>Who read the most books in Term 2? <m>\textbf{Brian}</m></li>
                        <li>We compare the Term 2 column: Alice = 5, Brian = 6, Carol = 4. The highest number is <m>\textbf{6}</m>, which belongs to <m>\textbf{Brian}</m>.</li>
                        <li>How many books did Brian read in total?</li>
                        <li>We add the numbers in Brian's row: 3 (Term 1) + 6 (Term 2) = 9. therefore he read a total of <m>\textbf{9 books}</m>.</li>
