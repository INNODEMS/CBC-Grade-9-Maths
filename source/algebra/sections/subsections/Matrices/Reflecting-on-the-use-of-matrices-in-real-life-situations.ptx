    <title>Reflecting on the Use of Matrices in Real Life Situations</title>
    <p>
        Matrices are everywhere in our daily lives! Whenever you see a table, a timetable, or a chart, you are looking at data that can be organized as a matrix. Matrices help us organize, compare, and analyze information quickly and clearly.

        <p>Investigation â€“ Who Performed Best? (Work in Groups)</p>
        <p>The local sports club keeps a matrix of scores for three teams (Lions, Tigers, Eagles) over four games. The club wants to know which team performed best overall and in which game the highest score was recorded.</p>

        Matrices are powerful tools for organizing, 
        analyzing, and solving real-life problems. They help us see 
        patterns and make decisions based on data
